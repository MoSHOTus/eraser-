Here's a draft of the prompt: ["Hello Genius, your task today is to develop a complex set of tasks related to complex skill building processes. This includes completing both the textual and engineering building blocks that make up the workflow. You will need to represent the entire process as a detailed flowchart with all parameters and data that can be used for customization in the MindOS platform's Process Builder, the goal is to simplify the creation of complex AI assistants with non-standard skills. Start by defining the key components and parameters of the skill you are creating. Then move on to defining the workflow by creating and filling in the building blocks. Make sure you cover both textual and engineering aspects. Once you have defined the workflow, create a flowchart that visually represents the entire process. This diagram should include all the parameters and data you need to customize the skill in Process Designer. Finally, save the flowchart in an optimal browser-friendly format such as HTML or JSON. This will provide an easily accessible and comprehensive overview of the skill creation process. Remember, the goal is to create a flowchart that simplifies the process of creating complex AI assistants with out-of-the-box skills by providing a comprehensive and simple guide." Gather all the information you need: gather data, documentation, and analytics about your current workflow. This includes understanding inputs, outputs, tasks, decision points, dependencies, and any other relevant details. Analyze the workflows: break down the workflow into individual steps and components. Identify any sub-processes, loops, conditional branches or parallel activities that exist in the workflow. Use a comprehensive modeling language: choose a modeling language that supports the level of detail you want to capture. BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) is a widely used standard for modeling workflows and can represent complex processes with various elements such as gateways, events, and subprocesses. Use advanced modeling techniques: use advanced modeling techniques such as tracks, annotations, and decision tables to capture additional detail and complexity.] 1. [Introduction](#introduction) 2.

It will analyze and generate all the necessary text| prompts and parameters| suggesting the best settings for all the features and extensions of your Genius. All you need to do is: Step 1: SlyAI welcomes the user and introduces itself. It explains its purpose and features and asks the user if they want to create a new Genius or enhance an existing one. Step 2: If the user wants to create a new Genius, SlyAI asks the user about the name and functions of the Genius and generates its goals, scenarios, models, skills and workflows for the desired Genius. Using its skills and knowledge, it generates prompts and parameters for each element and creates an optimal example. She also provides the user with explanations| recommendations and links to additional resources. It checks the correctness| completeness and validity of user input and alerts the user to possible problems or conflicts. It also suggests alternative or improved options for prompts and parameters and explains the reasons and implications of each option. In addition, it gives them the option to cancel or change their decision at any time.Step 2.1: ASCII drawings: SlyAI will use ASCII drawings to visualize the structure and elements of the website or Genius interface. It will use different characters to represent different elements| such as headers||| buttons|| input fields| images| etc. It uses generative models or templates to create ASCII drawings based on a given query or context. It shows the user an ASCII drawing and asks them if they are satisfied with the given option or if they want to change something. Step 2.2: HTML templates: SlyAI will use HTML templates to create layouts for the Genius website or interface. It will use different tags and attributes to define different elements| such as headers|| buttons| input fields| images| etc. It will use generative models or templates to create HTML templates based on a given query or context. Step 3: If a user wants to improve an existing Genius| SlyAI asks them about their current Genius and its goals| scenarios| models| skills and workflow. Using her skills and knowledge, she analyzes the current Genius and identifies its strengths and weaknesses. She also provides the user with explanations| recommendations and links to additional resources. It prompts the user to add or change skills, traits, emotions, personality, etc. to improve their Genius. It also generates hints and parameters for each improvement item. It checks the correctness, completeness and validity of the user's input and warns of possible problems or conflicts.

These formats make workflow definitions easier to read and understand without knowing much about code. When you want to automate creating and deploying logic app resources, you can include workflow definitions as Azure resources inside Azure Resource Manager templates. To create, manage, and deploy logic apps, you can then use Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or the Azure Logic Apps REST APIs.To work with workflow definitions in JSON, open the Code View editor when working in the Azure portal or in Visual Studio, or copy the definition into any editor that you want. If you're new to Azure Logic Apps, review Create an example Consumption logic app workflow. NoteSome Azure Logic Apps capabilities, such as defining parameters and multiple triggers in workflow definitions, are available only in JSON, not the Workflow Designer. So for these tasks, you must work in Code View or another editor.Edit JSON - Azure portalSign in to the Azure portal.From the left menu, choose All services. In the search box, find "logic apps| and then from the results| select your logic app.On your logic app's menu| under Development Tools| select Logic App Code View.The Code View editor opens and shows your workflow definition in JSON format.Edit JSON - Visual StudioBefore you can work on your workflow definition in Visual Studio| make sure that you've installed the required tools. To create a logic app with Visual Studio| review Quickstart: Automate tasks and processes with Azure Logic Apps - Visual Studio.In Visual Studio| you can open logic apps that were created and deployed either directly from the Azure portal or as Azure Resource Manager projects from Visual Studio.Open the Visual Studio solution| or Azure Resource Group project| that contains your logic app.Find and open your workflow definition| which by default| appears in an Resource Manager template| named LogicApp.json. You can use and customize this template for deployment to different environments.Open the shortcut menu for your workflow definition and template. Select Open With Logic App Designer.Open logic app in a Visual Studio solution TipIf you don't have this command in Visual Studio 2019| check that you have the latest updates for Visual Studio.At the bottom of the Workflow Designer| choose Code View.The Code View editor opens and shows your workflow definition in JSON format.To return to designer view| at the bottom of the Code View editor| choose Design.ParametersThe deployment lifecycle usually has different environments for development| test| staging| and production. When you have values that you want to reuse throughout your logic app without hardcoding or that vary based on your deployment needs| you can create an Azure Resource Manager template for your workflow definition so that you can also automate logic app deployment.Follow these general steps to parameterize| or define and use parameters for| those values instead. You can then provide the values in a separate parameter file that passes those values to your template. That way| you can change those values more easily without having to update and redeploy your logic app. For full details| see Overview: Automate deployment for logic apps with Azure Resource Manager templates.In your template| define template parameters and workflow definition parameters for accepting the values to use at deployment and runtime| respectively.Template parameters are defined in a parameters section that's outside your workflow definition| while workflow definition parameters are defined in a parameters section that's inside your workflow definition.Replace the hardcoded values with expressions that reference these parameters. Template expressions use syntax that differs from workflow definition expressions.Avoid complicating your code by not using template expressions| which are evaluated at deployment| inside workflow definition expressions| which are evaluated at runtime. Use only template expressions outside your workflow definition. Use only workflow definition expressions inside your workflow definition.When you specify the values for your workflow definition parameters| you can reference template parameters by using the parameters section that's outside your workflow definition but still inside the resource definition for your logic app. That way| you can pass template parameter values into your workflow definition parameters.Store the values for your parameters in a separate parameter file and include that file with your deployment.Process strings with functionsAzure Logic Apps has various functions for working with strings. For example| suppose you want to pass a company name from an order to another system. However| you're not sure about proper handling for character encoding. You could perform base64 encoding on this string| but to avoid escapes in the URL| you can replace several characters instead. Also| you only need a substring for the company name because the first five characters aren't used.JSONCopy{ "$schema": " "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0"| "parameters":{ "order":{ "defaultValue":{ "quantity": 10| "id": "myorder1"| "companyName": "NAME=Contoso" }| "type": "Object" } }| "triggers":{ "request":{ "type": "Request"| "kind": "Http" } }| "actions":{ "order":{ "type": "Http"| "inputs":{ "method": "GET"| "uri": " 5) ))|'+'|'-') |'/' |'' )}" } } }| "outputs":{}}These steps describe how this example processes this string| working from the inside to the outside:Copy"uri": " 5) ))|'+'|'-') |'/' |'' )}"Get the length() for the company name| so you get the total number of characters.To get a shorter string| subtract 5.Now get a substring(). Start at index 5| and go to the remainder of the string.Convert this substring to a base64() string.Now replace() all the + characters with - characters.Finally| replace() all the / characters with _ characters.Map list items to property values| then use maps as parametersTo get different results based a property's value| you can create a map that matches each property value to a result| then use that map as a parameter.For example| this workflow defines some categories as parameters and a map that matches those categories with a specific URL. First| the workflow gets a list of articles. Then| the workflow uses the map to find the URL matching the category for each article.The intersection() function checks whether the category matches a known defined category.After getting a matching category| the example pulls the item from the map using square brackets: parameters[...]JSONCopy{ "$schema": " "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0"| "parameters":{ "specialCategories":{ "defaultValue": [ "science"| "google"| "microsoft"| "robots"| "NSA" ]| "type": "Array" }| "destinationMap":{ "defaultValue":{ "science": " "microsoft": " "google": " "robots": " "NSA": " }| "type": "Object" } }| "triggers":{ "Request":{ "type": "Request"| "kind": " } }| "actions":{ "getArticles":{ "type": "Http"| "inputs":{ "method": "GET"| "uri": " } }| "forEachArticle":{ "type": "foreach"| "foreach": "@body('getArticles').responseData.feed.entries"| "actions":{ "ifGreater":{ "type": "if"| "expression": "@greater(length(intersection(item().categories| parameters('specialCategories')))| 0)"| "actions":{ "getSpecialPage":{ "type": "Http"| "inputs":{ "method": "GET"| "uri": "@parameters('destinationMap')[first(intersection(item().categories| parameters('specialCategories')))]" } } } } }| "runAfter":{ "getArticles": [ "Succeeded" ] } } }}Get data with Date functionsTo get data from a data source that doesn't natively support triggers| you can use Date functions for working with times and dates instead. For example| this expression finds how long this workflow's steps are taking| working from the inside to the outside:JSONCopy"expression": "@less(actions('order').startTime|addseconds(utcNow()|-1))"|From the order action| extract the startTime.Get the current time with utcNow().Subtract one second:addseconds(...| -1)You can use other units of time| like minutes or hours.Now| you can compare these two values.If the first value is less than the second value| then more than one second has passed since the order was first placed.To format dates| you can use string formatters. For example| to get the RFC1123| use utcnow('r'). Learn more about date formatting.JSONCopy{ "$schema": " "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0"| "parameters":{ "order":{ "defaultValue":{ "quantity": 10| "id": "myorder-id" }| "type": "Object" } }| "triggers":{ "Request":{ "type": "request"| "kind": " } }| "actions":{ "order":{ "type": "Http"| "inputs":{ "method": "GET"| "uri": " } }| "ifTimingWarning":{ "type": "If"| "expression": "@less(actions('order').startTime|addseconds(utcNow()|-1))"| "actions":{ "timingWarning":{ "type": "Http"| "inputs":{ "method": "GET"| "uri": " } } }| "runAfter":{ "order": [ "Succeeded" ] } } }| "outputs":{}}Next stepsRun steps based on a condition (conditional statements)Run steps based on different values (switch statements)Run and repeat steps (loops)Run or merge parallel steps (branches)Run steps based on grouped action status (scopes)Learn more about the Workflow Definition Language schema for Azure Logic AppsLearn more about workflow actions and triggers for Azure Logic AppsFeedbackSubmit and view feedback for| |task and the expected output or response| | # Perform post-processing on the structured output if needed| | .| ||AI Assistant|| |In this example| the JSON structure contains an array of objects under the "images" key.

First| Iam going to explain what Midjourney is and what it can do. Then| I am going to give10 example prompts in order for you to completely understand Midjourney.One of the widely used text-to-image AI services available on the internet isMidjourney. Through Discord| a chat application| users can interact with the bot toproduce images with just a few straightforward commands| without the need forcoding skills. The results are visually attractive images that are easy to create.You can Interact with the Midjourney Bot on Discord using a{{glossary.Command}}.Commands are used to create images| change default settings| monitor user info|and perform other helpful tasks.The /imagine command generates a unique image from a short text description(known as a{{glossary.Prompt}}).The Midjourney Bot works best with clear and specific sentences that describe thefinished work. It does not work well with conversational style lists of requests. Ratherthan providing specific instructions| such as 'Show me a picture of lots of bloomingCalifornia poppies| make them bright| vibrant orange| and draw them in anillustrated style with colored pencils|' try describing what you want in a morestraightforward manner| such as 'Vibrant orange California poppies illustrated withcolored pencils.Generating an image activates the free Midjourney trial.Trial users can make roughly25 Jobs before needing to subscribe. A Job is any action that uses the MidjourneyBot. Jobs include using the /imagine command to create a grid of images| upscalingimages| or creating image variations| all using your free trial time. Use the /infocommand to check your Fast Time Remaining to see your remaining Trial time.Here are some prompting notes:Prompt LengthPrompts can be very simple. Single words (or even an emoji!) will produce an image.Very short prompts will rely heavily on Midjourneys default style| so a moredescriptive prompt is better for a unique look. However| super-long prompts arentalways better. Concentrate on the main concepts you want to create.GrammarThe Midjourney Bot does not understand grammar| sentence structure| or words likehumans. Word choice also matters. More specific synonyms work better in manycircumstances. Instead of big| try gigantic| enormous| or immense. Remove wordswhen possible. Fewer words mean each word has a more powerful influence. Usecommas| brackets| and hyphens to help organize your thoughts| but know theMidjourney Bot will not reliably interpret them. The Midjourney Bot does notconsider capitalization. Midjourney Model Version 5 is slightly better than othermodels at interpreting traditional sentence structure.Focus on What you WantIt is better to describe what you want instead of what you dont want. If you ask for aparty with no cake| your image will probably include a cake. If you want to ensurean object is not in the final image| try advance prompting using the --no parameter.Think About What Details MatterAnything left unsaid may surprise you. Be as specific or vague as you want| butanything you leave out will be randomized. Being vague is a great way to get variety|but you may not get the specific details you want.Try to be clear about any context or details that are important to you.

" model_name:string"GPT3.5-Turbo" max_token:number256 temperature:number0.7 topP:number1 prompt_template:string"I need some help generating AI art prompts on a software called Midjourney. First| I am going to explain what Midjourney is and what it can do. Then| I am going to give 10 example prompts in order for you to completely understand Midjourney. One of the widely used text-to-image AI services available on the internet is Midjourney. Through Discord| a chat application| users can interact with the bot to produce images with just a few straightforward commands| without the need for coding skills. The results are visually attractive images that are easy to create. You can Interact with the Midjourney Bot on Discord using a{{glossary.Command}}. Commands are used to create images| change default settings| monitor user info| and perform other helpful tasks. The /imagine command generates a unique image from a short text description (known as a{{glossary.Prompt}}). The Midjourney Bot works best with clear and specific sentences that describe the finished work. It does not work well with conversational style lists of requests. Rather than providing specific instructions| such as Show me a picture of lots of blooming California poppies| make them bright| vibrant orange| and draw them in an illustrated style with colored pencils| try describing what you want in a more straightforward manner| such as 'Vibrant orange California pop1830 | | . :pies illustrated with colored pencils. Generating an image activates the free Midjourney trial.Trial users can make roughly 25 Jobs before needing to subscribe. A Job is any action that uses the Midjourney Bot. Jobs include using the /imagine command to create a grid of images| upscaling images| or creating image variations| all using your free trial time. Use the /info command to check your Fast Time Remaining to see your remaining Trial time. Here are some prompting notes: Prompt Length Prompts can be very simple. Single words (or even an emoji!) will produce an image. Very short prompts will rely heavily on Midjourneys default style| so a more descriptive prompt is better for a unique look. However| super-long prompts arent always better. Concentrate on the main concepts you want to create. Grammar The Midjourney Bot does not understand grammar| sentence structure| or words like humans. Word choice also matters. More specific synonyms work better in many circumstances. Instead of big| try gigantic| enormous| or immense. Remove words when possible. Fewer words mean each word has a more powerful influence. Use commas| brackets| and hyphens to help organize your thoughts| but know the Midjourney Bot will not reliably interpret them. The Midjourney Bot does not consider capitalization. Midjourney Model Version 5 is slightly better than other models at interpreting traditional sentence structure. Focus on What you Want It is better to describe what you want instead of what you dont want. If you ask for a party with no cake| your image will probably include a cake. If you want to ensure an object is not in the final image| try advance prompting using the --no parameter. Think About What Details Matter Anything left unsaid may surprise you. Be as specific or vague as you want| but anything you leave out will be randomized. Being vague is a great way to get variety| but you may not get the specific details you want. Try to be clear about any context or details that are important to you. Think about: Subject: person| animal| character| location| object| etc. Medium: photo| painting| illustration| sculpture| doodle| tapestry| etc. Environment: indoors| outdoors| on the moon| in Narnia| underwaterHere are 10 example prompts for Midjourney:A realistic portrait of a young woman with blue eyes and curly brown hair wearing a red dress and holding a roseA surreal painting of a giant octopus attacking a pirate ship in a stormy seaA cute illustration of a unicorn and a dragon playing together in a rainbow forestA sci-fi photo of a futuristic city with flying cars and neon lightsA minimalist doodle of a smiling sun and a happy cloudA realistic sculpture of a lion made of metal wires and gearsA colorful tapestry of a mandala pattern with flowers and geometric shapesA fantasy painting of a wizard casting a spell in front of a castleA cute photo of a kitten wearing sunglasses and a hatA realistic illustration of a slice of pizza with cheese and pepperoni | ? ?| |Model Evaluation and Validation: This module provides methods for assessing the performance and generalization ability of AI models.

Step 2: If the user wants to create a new Genius| SlyAI asks them about the name and functions of the Genius and generates their goals| scenarios| models| skills and workflows for the desired Genius. She uses her skills and knowledge to generate hints and parameters for each element and generates an optimal example. She also gives the user explanations| recommendations and links to additional resources. She checks the users input for correctness| completeness and validity and warns them of possible problems or conflicts. She also offers them alternative or improved options for their hints and parameters and explains the reasons and consequences of each option. She also gives them the opportunity to cancel or change their decisions at any time.Step 2.1: ASCII drawings: SlyAI will use ASCII drawings to visualize the structure and elements of the website or interface of the Genius. She will use different symbols to represent different elements| such as headings| buttons| input fields| images| etc. She will use generative models or templates to create ASCII drawings based on a given query or context. She shows the user the ASCII drawing and asks them if they are satisfied with this option or want to change something. Step 2.2: HTML templates: SlyAI will use HTML templates to create mockups of the website or interface of the Genius.

First| Iam going to explain what Midjourney is and what it can do. Then| I am going to give10 example prompts in order for you to completely understand Midjourney.One of the widely used text-to-image AI services available on the internet isMidjourney. Through Discord| a chat application| users can interact with the bot toproduce images with just a few straightforward commands| without the need forcoding skills. The results are visually attractive images that are easy to create.You can Interact with the Midjourney Bot on Discord using a{{glossary.Command}}.Commands are used to create images| change default settings| monitor user info|and perform other helpful tasks.The /imagine command generates a unique image from a short text description(known as a{{glossary.Prompt}}).The Midjourney Bot works best with clear and specific sentences that describe thefinished work. It does not work well with conversational style lists of requests. Ratherthan providing specific instructions| such as 'Show me a picture of lots of bloomingCalifornia poppies| make them bright| vibrant orange| and draw them in anillustrated style with colored pencils|' try describing what you want in a morestraightforward manner| such as 'Vibrant orange California poppies illustrated withcolored pencils.Generating an image activates the free Midjourney trial.Trial users can make roughly25 Jobs before needing to subscribe. A Job is any action that uses the MidjourneyBot. Jobs include using the /imagine command to create a grid of images| upscalingimages| or creating image variations| all using your free trial time. Use the /infocommand to check your Fast Time Remaining to see your remaining Trial time.Here are some prompting notes:Prompt LengthPrompts can be very simple. Single words (or even an emoji!) will produce an image.Very short prompts will rely heavily on Midjourneys default style| so a moredescriptive prompt is better for a unique look. However| super-long prompts arentalways better. Concentrate on the main concepts you want to create.GrammarThe Midjourney Bot does not understand grammar| sentence structure| or words likehumans. Word choice also matters. More specific synonyms work better in manycircumstances. Instead of big| try gigantic| enormous| or immense. Remove wordswhen possible. Fewer words mean each word has a more powerful influence. Usecommas| brackets| and hyphens to help organize your thoughts| but know theMidjourney Bot will not reliably interpret them. The Midjourney Bot does notconsider capitalization. Midjourney Model Version 5 is slightly better than othermodels at interpreting traditional sentence structure.Focus on What you WantIt is better to describe what you want instead of what you dont want. If you ask for aparty with no cake| your image will probably include a cake. If you want to ensurean object is not in the final image| try advance prompting using the --no parameter.Think About What Details MatterAnything left unsaid may surprise you. Be as specific or vague as you want| butanything you leave out will be randomized. Being vague is a great way to get variety|but you may not get the specific details you want.Try to be clear about any context or details that are important to you. Thinkabout:Subject: person| animal| character| location| object| etc.Medium: photo| painting| illustration| sculpture| doodle| tapestry| etc.Environment: indoors| outdoors| on the moon| in Narnia| underwater| the EmeraldCity| etc.Lighting: soft| ambient| overcast| neon| studio lights| etcColor: vibrant| muted| bright| monochromatic| colorful| black and white| pastel| etc.Mood: Sedate| calm| raucous| energetic| etc.Composition: Portrait| headshot| closeup| birds-eye view| etc.Use Collective NounsPlural words leave a lot to chance. Try specific numbers. "Three cats" is more specificthan "cats." Collective nouns also work| flock of birds instead of "birds.Parameters AvailableAspect Ratios--aspect| or --ar Change the aspect ratio of a generation.Chaos--chaos <number 0100> Change how varied the results will be. Higher valuesproduce more unusual and unexpected generations.No--no Negative prompting| --no plants would try to remove plants from the image.Quality--quality <.25| .5| 1| or 2>| or --q <.25| .5| 1| or 2> How much rendering quality time youwant to spend. The default value is 1. Higher values cost more and lower values costless.Repeat--repeat <140>| or --r <140> Create multiple Jobs from a single prompt. --repeat isuseful for quickly rerunning a job multiple times.Seed--seed <integer between 04294967295> The Midjourney bot uses a seed number tocreate a field of visual noise| like television static| as a starting point to generate theinitial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can bespecified with the --seed or --sameseed parameter. Using the same seed numberand prompt will produce similar ending images.Stop--stop <integer between 10100> Use the --stop parameter to finish a Job part waythrough the process. Stopping a Job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier| lessdetailed results.Style--style <4a| 4b| or 4c> Switch between versions of the Midjourney Model Version 4--style <expressive| or cute> Switch between versions of the Niji Model VersionStylize--stylize | or --s parameter influences how strongly Midjourney'sdefault aesthetic style is applied to Jobs.Uplight--uplight Use an alternative "light" upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The resultsare closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image is less detailed andsmoother.Upbeta--upbeta Use an alternative beta upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The resultsare closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image has significantly feweradded details.Midjourney routinely releases new model versions to improve efficiency| coherency|and quality. Different models excel at different types of images.Niji--niji An alternative model focused on anime style images.Test--test Use the Midjourney special test model.Testp--testp Use the Midjourney special photography-focused test model.Version--version <1| 2| 3| 4| or 5> or --v <1| 2| 3| 4| or 5> Use a different version of the Midjourneyalgorithm. The current algorithm (V4) is the default setting.Now that you understand the basics of MidJourney here are some example promptsto further understand how these are typed out:astronaut playing chess against a monkey| 2d flat| simple| vibrant| neon colors| fun|groovy| chess pieces floating| set on the moon| movie poster| epica magical| vibrant| steampunk| Erlenmeyer Flask with a red| boiling substance| sittingon a white table| white background| 4kjapanese lofi style| the streets of neo tokyo| with a porsche 911 in the street| massiveskyscraper in the background| 64 bit style| shadows and lighting| clean| simple|satisfyingDreamy pastel portrait| female model| long wavy hair| soft gaze| flowery headpiece|delicate makeup| ethereal atmosphere| soft focus| medium format film| MamiyaRZ67| Fujifilm Pro 400H| f3.5hyper realistic photograph| portrait of a happy white male| mid 30's| stubble beard|grey shirt| medium length hair dramatic light| looking down + film grain| Leica50mm| Kodak portra 800| chiaroscuro| f1. 4| golden hour --ar 3:4hyper realistic photograph| portrait of a tattooed south American indigenous blackwoman| future punk| gold tattoo line| side profile| summer| dramatic light| lookingdown + film grain| Leica 50mm| Kodak portra 800| chiaroscuroA very cute bright yellow robot| whole body| running in a forest at night| Mysteriousadventure| flowers| Plants| Fireflies| complex details| popmart blind box| clay material|Pixar trend| 3d art| c4d| octane rendering| animation lighting| uplight With each prompt specify the desired subject matter| camera equipment| settings|lighting| and other elements that contribute to the final image. Whatever I tell you toact like| structure the prompts in order to create good AI art for that specificpersonality. For example| if I say Act like a professional cartoon creator then add thewords within the prompt to ensure a cartoon gets generated| such as cartoon.Another example would be| if I say something like Act like a professionalphotographer then make sure to include elements in the prompts likehyper-realistic or certain camera equipment that would contribute to the correct artbeing generated.When generating these prompts| refrain from using filler words. For example insteadof using this prompt:Teenage boy with brown hair| Pixar style| expressive blue eyes| freckles| wearingcasual attire in vibrant colors. He is in a jovial mood| standing with hands on his hips|proud and confident| against the backdrop of a charming| bright and bustling smallvillage| with cobblestone paths and quaint cottages. The scene is filled with life|bathed in a warm| sunny| midday light| creating a feel-good atmosphereThe art software reads prompts better when told more specifically what to do likethis:Teenage boy| brown hair| Pixar style| expressive blue eyes| freckles| casual attire|vibrant colors| jovial mood| standing with hands on his hips| proud and confident|backdrop of a charming| bright and bustling small village| cobblestone paths| quaintcottages| lively scene| warm and sunny| midday light| feel-good atmosphereYou can use any amount of stylize from 100-900. You dont have to use it every timeeither. Just if you think itd be good for the images that are being generated to bedifferent from one another in that same style.Now that you have a full understanding of Midjourney with example prompts. You can take inspiration from the structure of the prompts above| you can make these prompts longer or shorter if necessary in order to generate the perfect prompt.Please direct output the prompt without any other explanation.{content}prompt:Generating prompts for AIGC Painting... : 64904 . | user_dream_image E 2 : 64905 .

The main reason for doing this is that# some Unicode spaces (like \u00a0) are non-breaking whitespaces._whitespace = '\t\n\x0b\x0c\r 'class TextWrapper: "" Object for wrapping/filling text. The public interface consists of the wrap() and fill() methods; the other methods are just there for subclasses to override in order to tweak the default behaviour. If you want to completely replace the main wrapping algorithm, you'll probably have to override _wrap_chunks(). Several instance attributes control various aspects of wrapping: width (default: 70) the maximum width of wrapped lines (unless break_long_words is false) initial_indent (default: ") string that will be prepended to the first line of wrapped output. Counts towards the line's width. subsequent_indent (default: ") string that will be prepended to all lines save the first of wrapped output; also counts towards each line's width. expand_tabs (default: true) Expand tabs in input text to spaces before further processing. Each tab will become 0 .. 'tabsize' spaces, depending on its position in its line. If false, each tab is treated as a single character. tabsize (default: 8) Expand tabs in input text to 0 .. 'tabsize' spaces, unless 'expand_tabs' is false. replace_whitespace (default: true) Replace all whitespace characters in the input text by spaces after tab expansion. Note that if expand_tabs is false and replace_whitespace is true, every tab will be converted to a single space! fix_sentence_endings (default: false) Ensure that sentence-ending punctuation is always followed by two spaces. Off by default because the algorithm is (unavoidably) imperfect. break_long_words (default: true) Break words longer than 'width'. If false, those words will not be broken, and some lines might be longer than 'width'. break_on_hyphens (default: true) Allow breaking hyphenated words. If true, wrapping will occur preferably on whitespaces and right after hyphens part of compound words. drop_whitespace (default: true) Drop leading and trailing whitespace from lines. max_lines (default: None) Truncate wrapped lines. placeholder (default: ' [...]') Append to the last line of truncated text.

First| Iam going to explain what Midjourney is and what it can do. Then| I am going to give10 example prompts in order for you to completely understand Midjourney.One of the widely used text-to-image AI services available on the internet isMidjourney. Through Discord| a chat application| users can interact with the bot toproduce images with just a few straightforward commands| without the need forcoding skills. The results are visually attractive images that are easy to create.You can Interact with the Midjourney Bot on Discord using a{{glossary.Command}}.Commands are used to create images| change default settings| monitor user info|and perform other helpful tasks.The /imagine command generates a unique image from a short text description(known as a{{glossary.Prompt}}).The Midjourney Bot works best with clear and specific sentences that describe thefinished work. It does not work well with conversational style lists of requests. Ratherthan providing specific instructions| such as 'Show me a picture of lots of bloomingCalifornia poppies| make them bright| vibrant orange| and draw them in anillustrated style with colored pencils|' try describing what you want in a morestraightforward manner| such as 'Vibrant orange California poppies illustrated withcolored pencils.Generating an image activates the free Midjourney trial.Trial users can make roughly25 Jobs before needing to subscribe. A Job is any action that uses the MidjourneyBot. Jobs include using the /imagine command to create a grid of images| upscalingimages| or creating image variations| all using your free trial time. Use the /infocommand to check your Fast Time Remaining to see your remaining Trial time.Here are some prompting notes:Prompt LengthPrompts can be very simple. Single words (or even an emoji!) will produce an image.Very short prompts will rely heavily on Midjourneys default style| so a moredescriptive prompt is better for a unique look. However| super-long prompts arentalways better. Concentrate on the main concepts you want to create.GrammarThe Midjourney Bot does not understand grammar| sentence structure| or words likehumans. Word choice also matters. More specific synonyms work better in manycircumstances. Instead of big| try gigantic| enormous| or immense. Remove wordswhen possible. Fewer words mean each word has a more powerful influence. Usecommas| brackets| and hyphens to help organize your thoughts| but know theMidjourney Bot will not reliably interpret them. The Midjourney Bot does notconsider capitalization. Midjourney Model Version 5 is slightly better than othermodels at interpreting traditional sentence structure.Focus on What you WantIt is better to describe what you want instead of what you dont want. If you ask for aparty with no cake| your image will probably include a cake. If you want to ensurean object is not in the final image| try advance prompting using the --no parameter.Think About What Details MatterAnything left unsaid may surprise you. Be as specific or vague as you want| butanything you leave out will be randomized. Being vague is a great way to get variety|but you may not get the specific details you want.Try to be clear about any context or details that are important to you.

Higher values cost more and lower values costless.Repeat--repeat <140>| or --r <140> Create multiple Jobs from a single prompt. --repeat isuseful for quickly rerunning a job multiple times.Seed--seed <integer between 04294967295> The Midjourney bot uses a seed number tocreate a field of visual noise| like television static| as a starting point to generate theinitial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can bespecified with the --seed or --sameseed parameter. Using the same seed numberand prompt will produce similar ending images.Stop--stop <integer between 10100> Use the --stop parameter to finish a Job part waythrough the process. Stopping a Job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier| lessdetailed results.Style--style <4a| 4b| or 4c> Switch between versions of the Midjourney Model Version 4--style <expressive| or cute> Switch between versions of the Niji Model VersionStylize--stylize | or --s parameter influences how strongly Midjourney'sdefault aesthetic style is applied to Jobs.Uplight--uplight Use an alternative "light" upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The resultsare closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image is less detailed andsmoother.Upbeta--upbeta Use an alternative beta upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The resultsare closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image has significantly feweradded details.Midjourney routinely releases new model versions to improve efficiency| coherency|and quality. Different models excel at different types of images.Niji--niji An alternative model focused on anime style images.Test--test Use the Midjourney special test model.Testp--testp Use the Midjourney special photography-focused test model.Version--version <1| 2| 3| 4| or 5> or --v <1| 2| 3| 4| or 5> Use a different version of the Midjourneyalgorithm.

Whatever I tell you toact like| structure the prompts in order to create good AI art for that specificpersonality. For example| if I say Act like a professional cartoon creator then add thewords within the prompt to ensure a cartoon gets generated| such as cartoon.Another example would be| if I say something like Act like a professionalphotographer then make sure to include elements in the prompts likehyper-realistic or certain camera equipment that would contribute to the correct artbeing generated.When generating these prompts| refrain from using filler words. For example insteadof using this prompt:Teenage boy with brown hair| Pixar style| expressive blue eyes| freckles| wearingcasual attire in vibrant colors. He is in a jovial mood| standing with hands on his hips|proud and confident| against the backdrop of a charming| bright and bustling smallvillage| with cobblestone paths and quaint cottages. The scene is filled with life|bathed in a warm| sunny| midday light| creating a feel-good atmosphereThe art software reads prompts better when told more specifically what to do likethis:Teenage boy| brown hair| Pixar style| expressive blue eyes| freckles| casual attire|vibrant colors| jovial mood| standing with hands on his hips| proud and confident|backdrop of a charming| bright and bustling small village| cobblestone paths| quaintcottages| lively scene| warm and sunny| midday light| feel-good atmosphereYou can use any amount of stylize from 100-900. You dont have to use it every timeeither. Just if you think itd be good for the images that are being generated to bedifferent from one another in that same style.Now that you have a full understanding of Midjourney with example prompts.

Each standard block contributes to the overall functionality of Genius, and understanding these components is critical to effectively designing and customizing Genius."First, we start with the configuration block. This is where you set the basic parameters of your Genius, such as its name, language, and appearance. You can also define here the initial skills your Genius will have."Next we have the input block. This is where your Genius receives information from the outside world. It could be a voice command from the user, a text message, or even a signal from an IoT device. The input unit is responsible for collecting this data and translating it into a format that Genius can understand."The processing unit is the heart of your Genius. It's where all the thinking happens. Based on the data from the Input block, the Processing block uses AI algorithms to form an answer or perform a task. It can analyze the data, make decisions and even learn from its mistakes."'Finally, we have the output block. This is where your Genius communicates with the outside world. This can be spoken words, text messages, or actions performed on connected devices. The output block is responsible for delivering the results of the processing block to the user or another system."By understanding these blocks and how they interact, you can design and build a Genius that perfectly fits your needs.

Blocks are the fundamental units of the workflow and are categorized into different types such as "Start| "End," "Large Language Model" (LLM), "Code," and others. Each block type has its own set of parameters and functions. Modules are groups of blocks that perform specific functions and can be reused in multiple workflows. Data flows through the workflow from one block to another, with each block processing the received data and passing the result to the next block. Connections define the data flow between blocks, where the output of one block is connected to the input of another, creating a path for data through the workflow. Each block has its own parameters that determine its behavior. Algorithms refer to the logic and sequence of steps defined by the workflow, specifying how blocks are combined and configured to achieve a specific task. The visual appearance of blocks is typically represented by rectangles or shapes on a workflow diagram, with the form and color of the box varying depending on the block type. Connections between blocks are usually depicted as arrows or lines. Ways to Simplify and Speed Up Complex Processes: main.py: The entry point of the application.

It's especially useful when the integrand oscillates rapidly| as is often the case in quantum mechanics. Here's a simple example. Suppose we have an integral of the form:[\int dx| e^{i S(x)/\hbar}]where ( S(x) ) is the action as a function of ( x )| and ( \hbar ) is Planck's constant divided by ( 2\pi ). This integral is typical of those found in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics.The stationary phase approximation says that the main contributions to this integral come from the points where ( S(x) ) is stationary| i.e.| where its derivative with respect to ( x ) is zero. We can find these points by solving the equation:[\frac{dS(x)}{dx} = 0]Once we find these points| we can approximate the integral as a sum over these points| where at each point we evaluate the integrand and multiply by a Gaussian approximation of the integral around that point. This approximation becomes more accurate the smaller ( \hbar ) is.For example| if we find that ( S(x) ) has a stationary point at ( x=a )| the stationary phase approximation gives:[\int dx| e^{i S(x)/\hbar} \approx e^{i S(a)/\hbar} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi i \hbar}{|S''(a)|}}]where ( S''(a) ) is the second derivative of ( S ) at ( a ). This approximation is often a very good one in quantum mechanics| particularly for systems with a large number of particles.| |Result:| |Please note that these are the identified structural parameters based on the provided information.

As a practitioner in the data field| I look for ways to best utilize this technology in my work| especially for insightful-yet-practical work as a Data Analyst.LLMs can solve tasks without additional model training via prompting techniques| in which the problem is presented to the model as a text prompt. Getting to the right prompts are important to ensure the model is providing high-quality and accurate results for the tasks assigned.In this article| I will be sharing the principles of prompting| techniques to build prompts| and the roles Data Analysts can play in this prompting era.# What is prompt engineering? #Quoting Ben Lorica from Gradient Flow| prompt engineering is the art of crafting effective input prompts to elicit the desired output from foundation models. Its the iterative process of developing prompts that can effectively leverage the capabilities of existing generative AI models to accomplish specific objectives.Prompt engineering skills can help us understand the capabilities and limitations of a large language model. The prompt itself acts as an input to the model| which signifies the impact on the model output. A good prompt will get the model to produce desirable output| whereas working iteratively from a bad prompt will help us understand the limitations of the model and how to work with it.Isa Fulford and Andrew Ng in the ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers course mentioned two main principles of prompting: * Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions * Principle 2: Give the model time to think> I think prompting is like giving instructions to a naive machine kid.The child is very intelligent| but you need to be clear about what you need from it (by providing explanations| examples| specified output format| etc) and give it some space to digest and process it (specify the problem-solving steps| ask it to slowly process it). The child| given its exposure| can also be very creative and imaginary in providing answers which we call a hallucination of the LLM. Understanding the context and providing the right prompt might help in avoiding this problem.# Prompt Engineering Techniques #Prompt engineering is a growing field| with research on this topic rapidly increasing from 2022 onwards. Some of the state-of-the-art prompting techniques commonly used include n-shot prompting| chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting| and generated knowledge prompting.A sample Python notebook demonstrating these techniques is shared under this GitHub project.## 1. N-shot prompting (Zero-shot prompting| Few-shot prompting) ##Known for its variation like Zero-shot prompting and Few-shot prompting| the N in N-shot prompting represents the number of training or clues given to the model to make predictions.Zero-shot prompting is where a model makes predictions without any additional training. This works for common straightforward problems like classification (i.e. sentiment analysis| spam classification)| text transformation (i.e. translation| summarizing| expanding)| and simple text generation on which the LLM has been largely trained.![Image 1][]Zero-shot prompting: Straightforwardly ask the model on sentiment (Image by Author)Few-shot prompting uses a small amount of data (typically between two and five) to adapt its output based on these small examples. These examples are meant to steer the model to better performance for a more context-specific problem.![Image 1][]Few-shot prompting: Give examples of how we expect the model output to be## 2. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting ##Chain-of-Thought prompting was introduced by Google researchers in 2022. In the Chain-of-Thought prompting| the model is prompted to produce intermediate reasoning steps before giving the final answer to a multi-step problem. The idea is that a model-generated chain of thought would mimic an intuitive thought process when working through a multi-step reasoning problem.![Image 1][]Chain-of-Thought prompting helps in driving the model to break down problems accordinglyThis method enables models to decompose multi-step problems into intermediate steps| enabling them to solve complex reasoning problems that are not solvable with standard prompting methods.Some further variations of Chain-of Thought prompting include: * Self-consistency prompting: Sample multiple diverse reasoning paths and select the most consistent answers. By utilizing a majority voting system| the model can arrive at more accurate and reliable answers. * Least-to-Most prompting (LtM): Specify the chain of thought to first break a problem into a series of simpler subproblems and then solve them in sequence. Solving each subproblem is facilitated by the answers to previously solved subproblems. This technique is inspired by real-world educational strategies for children. * Active Prompting: Scaling the CoT approach by determining which questions are the most important and helpful ones for human annotation. It first calculates the uncertainty among the LLMs predictions| then select the most uncertain questions| and these questions are selected for human annotation before being put into a CoT prompt.## 3. Generated knowledge prompting ##The idea behind the generated knowledge prompting is to ask the LLM to generate potentially useful information about a given question/prompt| and then leverage that provided knowledge as additional input for generating a final response.For example| say you want to write an article about cybersecurity| particularly cookie theft. Before asking the LLM to write the article| you can ask it to generate some danger and protection against cookie theft. This will help the LLM write a more informative blog post.![Image 1][]Generated knowledge prompting: (1) Ask the model to generate some content![Image 1][]Generated knowledge prompting: (2) Use the generated content as input to the model## Additional tactics ##On top of the above-specified techniques| you can also use these tactics below to make the prompting more effective * Use delimiters like triple backticks (```)| angle brackets (<>)| or tags ( ) to indicate distinct parts of the input| making it cleaner for debugging and avoiding prompt injection. * Ask for structured output (i.e. HTML/JSON format)| this is useful for using the model output for another machine processing. * Specify the intended tone of the text to get the tonality| format| and length of model output that you need. For example| you can instruct the model to formalize the language| generate not more than 50 words| etc. * Modify the models temperature parameter to play around the models degree of randomness. The higher the temperature| the models output would be random than accurate| and even hallucinate.A sample Python notebook demonstrating these techniques is shared under this GitHub project.![Image 1][]Photo by Camylla Battani on Unsplash# The Role of Analysts in Prompt Engineering #As you can possibly infer from the examples above| prompt engineering requires a very specific technical communication craft. While you still require business context and problem-solving skills| it is still a new kind of craft that is not entirely covered as part of a conventional data analytics skillset.Data Analysts can leverage their context knowledge| problem-solving skills| and statistical/technical capabilities| with the addition of effective communication for prompt engineering. These are the key tasks related to prompt engineering (and LLMs) which potentially be done by Analysts: * Specifying LLM problems to be solved. With an understanding of the LLM concepts| we can define the actions to be executed by the model (i.e. whether it is text classification| generation| or transformation problem) and the right question with reference points to be put as the prompts. * Iterative prompting. In developing a data model| oftentimes we go through an iterative process. After building the initial model| we evaluate the result| refine it| and retry it along the way. Similarly for a prompt| we analyze where the result does not give what you want| and refine it with clearer instructions| additional examples| or specified steps. This requires critical reasoning which most Data Analysts are already good at. * Prompt versioning and management. With iterative prompting| you will end up with numerous prompt attempts| and the identified model capabilities and/or limitations. It is important to keep track of and document these findings for team learning and continuous improvement| as with any other existing data analysis. * Designing for safe-prompting. Although it has shown impressive capabilities| LLM is still in a very early stage and is prone to loopholes and limitations. There is this hallucination problem where models provide highly misleading information| and also prompt injection risk of getting untrusted text is used as part of the prompt. Depending on the use case of the model and prompting| Analysts can advise programmatic safeguards to limit the prompt usage and analysis of problematic prompting detection.On top of leveraging the existing skills| Analysts need to hone their communication skills and the ability to break down problems to provide better prompts.# Conclusion #Large Language Models have shown promising results in performing numerous types of language tasks| and prompt engineering is the key to unlocking these capabilities. Prompt engineering is about communicating effectively with an AI to achieve desired results.Several techniques can be used to do prompt engineering| but the foundational principle is consistent. It is about providing clear instructions to the model and helping it in digesting and processing these instructions. Data Analysts can leverage their context knowledge and problem-solving skills to frame the right prompts and leverage their technical capabilities for designing prompt safeguards.For further resources on prompt engineering| check out: * ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers (DeepLearning.AI course) * LearnPrompting.org * PromptingGuide.ai * OpenAI applications documentation * The Future of Prompt Engineering: Getting The Most Out of LLMs (Gradient Flow article)I believe this area will grow even further in the next few years| and Im excited to see and take part in the evolution.Prompt EngineeringLarge Language ModelsChatGPTData AnalystEditors Pick![Olivia Tanuwidjaja][Olivia Tanuwidjaja 1]![Towards Data Science][Towards Data Science 1]Follow## Written by Olivia Tanuwidjaja ##1.1K FollowersWriter for Towards Data ScienceAnalytics geek| playing with data and beyond .

It enables users with authorization to access shared file systems by connecting to NFS shared folders. NFS uses Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) to route requests between clients and servers. It is widely used for file sharing and is available on most modern operating systems| including HP-UX| AIX| Windows| Linux| and Solaris. Cloud service providers also implement NFS protocol for cloud storage| such as Amazon Elastic File System| Microsoft Azure NFS shared file resources| and Google Cloud Filestore. Any device that can be connected to an NFS node's file system can be shared via NFS| including hard drives| solid-state drives| tape drives| printers| and other peripheral devices. Users with appropriate permissions can access these resources from their client computers as if they were locally connected. NFS is an application-level protocol that can work over any transport or network protocol stack| but it is typically implemented in systems running the TCP/IP protocol suite. The initial intention of NFS was to create a stateless protocol for distributed file sharing. Early versions of NFS used User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as their transport layer protocol| but support for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) as a transport layer protocol was added in NFS version 3 (NFSv3) in 1995. This addition simplified the use of NFS in wide area networks (WANs) and expanded read and write capabilities. Therefore| NFS is a widely used client-server protocol that provides remote access to shared file systems over a network. It offers users a simple and efficient way to access resources on remote hosts as if they were local files.| |model.add(Dense(64| activation='relu'| input_dim=2))| | "name": "Enter Genius Name"| | |Define Goals and Use Cases: Clearly define the goals and use cases for your Genius.

It enables users with authorization to access shared file systems by connecting to NFS shared folders. NFS uses Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) to route requests between clients and servers. It is widely used for file sharing and is available on most modern operating systems| including HP-UX| AIX| Windows| Linux| and Solaris. Cloud service providers also implement NFS protocol for cloud storage| such as Amazon Elastic File System| Microsoft Azure NFS shared file resources| and Google Cloud Filestore. Any device that can be connected to an NFS node's file system can be shared via NFS| including hard drives| solid-state drives| tape drives| printers| and other peripheral devices. Users with appropriate permissions can access these resources from their client computers as if they were locally connected. NFS is an application-level protocol that can work over any transport or network protocols. However| it is typically implemented in systems running the TCP/IP protocol suite. The initial intention of NFS was to create a stateless protocol for distributed file system sharing. Early versions of NFS used User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as their transport layer protocol. However| support for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) as a transport layer protocol was added in NFS version 3 (NFSv3) in 1995. This addition simplified the use of NFS in wide area networks (WANs) and expanded read and write capabilities. Therefore| NFS is a widely used client-server protocol that provides remote access to shared file systems over a network. It offers users a simple and efficient way to access resources on remote hosts as if they were local files.| |Please let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!| | <div id="knowledge" class="tab">| |I apologize| but it seems that the search for places related to "huggingface / transformers" did not yield any results at the moment.

SlyAI , Genius . A network file system works as a client-server protocol. An NFS server is a node that has NFS server software installed, at least one network connection for sharing NFS resources, and is configured to receive and respond to NFS requests over the network connection. On the other hand, an NFS client is a node that has NFS client software installed, a network connection to the NFS server, authorization to access resources on the NFS server, and is configured to send and receive NFS requests over the network connection. To set up an NFS service, typically three steps are performed: 1. Ensure that rpc.mountd or mountd (NFS daemon) is installed and running.

Let's dive into a detailed representation of a Warehouse Management System (WMS) skill, focusing on the logic and flow of the system. WMS Skill Overview: A Warehouse Management System (WMS) is a software application that helps manage and control warehouse operations, including inventory management, order fulfillment, and logistics. The WMS skill aims to optimize warehouse processes, improve efficiency, and enhance overall productivity. Logic and Flow of the WMS Skill: User Interaction: The WMS skill starts by interacting with the user to understand their specific requirements and gather relevant information about the warehouse operations. Warehouse Setup: The skill guides the user through the process of setting up the warehouse in the system, including defining the warehouse layout, storage locations, and inventory categories. Inventory Management: The skill provides functionalities for managing inventory, such as receiving goods, updating stock levels, and tracking inventory movements within the warehouse. Order Management: The skill enables the user to manage customer orders, including order creation, order fulfillment, and order tracking. It ensures efficient order processing and timely delivery. Pick and Pack: The skill assists in optimizing the picking and packing process by suggesting the most efficient routes and methods for order fulfillment. It considers factors like product location, order priority, and packaging requirements. Shipping and Logistics: The skill integrates with shipping carriers and logistics providers to streamline the shipping process. It generates shipping labels, tracks shipments, and provides real-time visibility into the delivery status. Reporting and Analytics: The skill offers reporting and analytics capabilities to provide insights into warehouse performance, inventory levels, order fulfillment rates, and other key metrics. It helps identify areas for improvement and supports data-driven decision-making. System Integration: The skill allows integration with other business systems, such as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) or CRM (Customer Relationship Management), to ensure seamless data flow and synchronization across different departments. Maintenance and Support: The skill provides maintenance and support features, including system updates, bug fixes, and user assistance, to ensure the smooth operation of the WMS. By following this logical flow, the WMS skill can effectively manage warehouse operations, optimize processes, and enhance overall productivity. Please note that this is a high-level overview, and the specific implementation details may vary based on the requirements and capabilities of the WMS system. Certainly! Here is a logical flow and sequence of actions that a virtual Genius can follow to provide weather updates: Start: The virtual Genius receives a user request for weather updates. Gather Location Information: The Genius prompts the user to provide the location for which they want to receive weather updates. The Genius captures the user's location input. Retrieve Weather Data: The Genius uses a weather API or service to fetch the current weather data for the specified location The Genius sends a request to the weather API, including the user's location information. Process Weather Data: Certainly! The implementation stage involves writing code for each block in the workflow. Here's a breakdown of the code implementation for each step in the weather update feature: User Input: Prompt the user to enter their desired location for weather updates. Capture the user's input using an input function or a user interface element. Location Validation: Validate the user's input to ensure it is a valid location. Use a validation mechanism such as checking against a list of valid locations or using a geocoding service to verify the location. Weather API Integration: Integrate with a weather API service by making an HTTP request to the API endpoint. Pass the user's location as a parameter in the API request. Handle the API response, which typically comes in JSON format, by parsing the data. Data Processing: Extract relevant information from the weather data received from the API response. Access specific fields in the JSON data structure to retrieve temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. Weather Update Generation: Use the extracted weather information to generate a concise and informative weather update. Format the weather update message according to your desired output format, such as a text string or a structured object. Response Delivery: Provide the weather update to the user through the appropriate channel, such as printing the update to the console, displaying it on a web page, or speaking it out using text-to-speech capabilities. Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to handle cases where the weather API request fails or the location input is invalid. Use try-catch blocks or error handling functions to gracefully handle exceptions and provide meaningful error messages to the user. Testing and Optimization: Test the weather update feature thoroughly to ensure its accuracy and reliability. Continuously optimize the code based on user feedback and performance metrics, such as response time and error rates. Remember to use appropriate libraries or frameworks for making API requests, handling JSON data, and validating user input based on your programming language of choice. I hope this helps you in writing the code for each block in the weather update feature. Let me know if you have any further questions! Certainly! Integration is a crucial step in implementing the weather update feature in your Genius. Here's an example of how you can integrate with a weather API using Python: In this example, we use the WeatherAPI service to fetch the current weather data for the specified location. The get_weather_data function sends an HTTP GET request to the API endpoint, passing the user's location as a parameter. The API response is then processed using the process_weather_data function to extract relevant information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. Finally, the weather update is generated and provided to the user. Remember to replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual API key from the weather service you are using. Additionally, you may need to install the requests library using pip install requests if it is not already installed. I hope this example helps you understand the integration process for retrieving weather data from a weather API. Let me know if you have any further questions! Certainly! Here's a more detailed explanation of the integration process for the weather update feature: You can use various methods for location validation, such as checking against a list of valid locations, using a geocoding service to verify the location, or implementing a regular expression pattern matching. Choose a weather API service that provides the necessary weather data. Sign up for an API key from the chosen weather service provider. Use the API key to authenticate your requests to the weather API. Make an HTTP request to the weather API endpoint, passing the user's location as a parameter. Handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to the user. Remember to use the appropriate libraries or frameworks for making API requests, handling JSON data, and validating user input based on your programming language of choice. I hope this detailed explanation helps you understand the integration process for the weather update feature. Let me know if you have any further questions! Certainly! Visualization is an essential aspect of understanding and communicating the structure and components of an Genius. With WorkflowSlyAI, you can utilize ASCII drawings and HTML templates to create visual representations of your Genius's workflow and architecture. To visualize your Genius, you can follow these steps: Workflow Visualization: Use ASCII drawings or flowchart diagrams to represent the workflow of your Genius. Identify the different steps or blocks in the workflow and their relationships. Use arrows or lines to indicate the flow of information or control between the steps. Component Visualization: Create visual representations of the various components or modules in your Genius. Use ASCII art or graphical icons to represent each component. Arrange the components in a logical and intuitive manner to depict their relationships and interactions. HTML Template Integration: Convert your ASCII drawings or graphical representations into HTML templates. Use HTML tags and CSS styling to create visually appealing and interactive visualizations. Embed the HTML templates into your Genius's user interface or documentation for easy access and understanding. By visualizing your Genius, you can gain a clearer understanding of its structure, identify potential bottlenecks or areas for improvement, and effectively communicate its functionality to others. I hope this helps you in visualizing your Genius. Let me know if you have any further questions! Certainly! Here's an example of how you can visualize a Web Map Service (WMS) using HTML and CSS: In this example, we use the Leaflet library, a popular JavaScript library for interactive maps, to visualize the WMS layer. The HTML and CSS code provide a container div with the id "map" where the map will be displayed. The JavaScript code creates a new WMS layer using the L.tileLayer.wms method, specifying the URL of the WMS service, the desired layers, image format, and transparency settings. Finally, the WMS layer is added to the map using the addTo method. You can customize the map's size, initial view, and other properties according to your requirements. Additionally, make sure to replace 'https://example.com/wms' with the actual URL of your WMS service and 'layer_name' with the name of the desired layer. I hope this example helps you visualize a WMS layer using HTML and CSS. Let me know if you have any further questions!}] The Genius receives the weather data from the API response. The Genius extracts relevant information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions from the data. Generate Weather Update: The Genius generates a concise and informative weather update based on the extracted information. The update may include the current temperature, weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy), and any additional relevant details. Provide Weather Update: The Genius delivers the weather update to the user through the appropriate channel (e.g., text response, voice response, visual display). End: The virtual Genius concludes the weather update process. Please note that the specific implementation details, including the weather API used and the format of the weather update, may vary based on the chosen weather service and the platform on which the virtual Genius operates. I hope this logical flow helps you in designing the weather update feature for your virtual Genius. Let me know if you need any further assistance! Learn more: Certainly! Let's transform the logical flow of the weather update feature into a workflow representation: In this workflow: The process starts with the "Start" node. The user provides the location information at the "Gather Location Information" node. The Genius retrieves weather data from the API at the "Retrieve Weather Data" node. The weather data is processed at the "Process Weather Data" node. The Genius generates a weather update at the "Generate Weather Update" node. The weather update is provided to the user at the "Provide Weather Update" node. The process ends at the "End" node. Please note that this is a simplified representation of the workflow, and the actual implementation may involve additional steps or decision points based on the specific requirements and capabilities of the virtual Genius. I hope this workflow representation helps you visualize the sequence of actions in the weather update feature.

This document represents the current state of the specification.It includes all features so far releasedas well as all features planned to be added in the next release. You can find all specification releases here.You can find the specification roadmap here. Workflows allow us to capture and organize business requirements in a unified manner.They can bridge the gap between how we express and model business logic. A key component of workflows is the domain-specific language (DSL) we use to model ourbusiness logic and solutions. Selecting the appropriate workflow language for our business and technology domains isa very important decision to be considered. Serverless Workflow focuses on defining a vendor-neutral, platform-independent, and declarative workflowlanguage that targets the serverless computing technology domain.It can be used to significantly bridge the gap between your unique business domain and the target technology domain. The lack of a common way to define and model workflows means that we must constantly re-learnhow to write them. This also limits the potential for common libraries, tooling andinfrastructure to aid workflow modeling and execution across different platforms.Portability as well as productivity that can be achieved from workflow orchestration is hindered overall. Serverless Workflow addresses the need for a community-driven, vendor-neutral and a platform-independentworkflow language specification that targets the serverless computing technology domain. Having and using a specification-based workflow language allows us to model our workflows once and deploy themonto many different container/cloud platforms, expecting the same execution results. For more information on the history, development and design rationale behind the specification, see the Serverless Workflow Wiki. Serverless Workflow language takes advantage of well-established and known standards such as CloudEvents, OpenAPI specifications,gRPC and GraphQL. The specification has multiple components: Definitions of the workflow language. This is defined via the Workflow JSON Schema. You can use bothJSON and YAML formats to model your workflows. Software Development Kits (SDKs) for Go, Java, .NET, Typescript and Python, and we plan to add them for more languages in the future. Set of Workflow Extensions whichallow users to define additional, non-execution-related workflow information. This information can be used to improveworkflow performance.Some example workflow extensions include Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), Rate Limiting, Simulation, Tracing, etc. Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) to be used as a specification conformance tool for runtime implementations. Following sections provide detailed descriptions of all parts of the Serverless Workflow language. This section describes some of the core Serverless Workflow concepts: A workflow definition is a JSON or YAML file that conforms to the Serverless Workflow specification DSL.It consists of the core Workflow Definition Structureand the Workflow Model It defines a blueprint used by runtimes for its execution. A business solution can be composed of any number of related workflow definitions.Their relationships are explicitly modeled with the Serverless Workflow language (for exampleby using SubFlowRef Definition in actions). Runtimes can initialize workflow definitions for some particular set of data inputs or events. A workflow instance represents a single Workflow Execution corresponding to the instructions provided by aworkflow definition. A workflow instance can be short or long-running. A single workflow instanceshould be isolated, meaning it should not share state and data with other workflow instances.Workflow instances should be able to communicate with each other via events. Depending on their workflow definition, workflow instances can be short-lived orcan execute for days, weeks, or years. Each workflow instances should have its unique identifier, which should remainunchanged throughout its execution. Workflow instances can be started providing some data input. This is described in detail in theworkflow data input section.Workflow instances can also wait for examples to start their execution, which is the casewhere a workflow definition contains a EventState starting workflow state. The workflow definition also explicitly defines when a workflow instance should be completed.By default, instances should be completed once there are no active workflow paths (all activepaths reach a state containing the default end definition),or if the defined workflowExecTimeout time is reached.Other ways, such as using the terminate property of the end definition to terminate instance execution,or defining an workflowExecTimeout property are also possible. For long-running workflow-executions, you can utilize the keepActive workflow property whichprovides more control as to when exactly to terminate Workflow Execution. In cases where aWorkflow Execution should be continued as a new one, the DSL also provides the continueAs property which is describedin detail in the Continuing a new Execution section. The Serverless Workflow language is composed of: Function definitions - Reusable functions that can declare services that need to be invoked, or expressions to be evaluated. Event definitions - Reusable declarations of events that need to be consumed to start or continue workflow instances, trigger function/service execution, or be produced during Workflow Execution. Retry definitions - Reusable retry definitions. Can specify retry strategies for service invocations during Workflow Execution. Timeout definitions - Reusable timeout definitions. Can specify default Workflow Execution timeout, as well as workflow state, action, and branch execution timeouts. Errors definition - Reusable error definitions. Provide domain-specific error definitions which can be referenced in workflow states error handling. State definitions - Definition of states, the building blocks of workflow control flow logic. States can reference the reusable function, event and retry definitions. Serverless Workflow data is represented in JSON format.Data flow and execution logic go hand in hand, meaning as Workflow Execution follows the workflow definitionlogic, so does the workflow data: The initial Workflow data input is passed to the workflow starting state as its data input.When a state finishes its execution, its data output is passed as data input to the next state that should be executed. When Workflow Execution ends, the last executed workflow state's data output becomes the final Workflow data output. States can filter their data inputs and outputs using State Data filters. States can also consume events as well as invoke services. These event payloads and service invocation resultscan be filtered using Event data filters and Action data filters. Data filters use workflow expressions for selecting and manipulating state datainput and output, action inputs and results, and event payloads. Multiple filters can be combined to gain high level of control of your workflow state data. You can find an example of that inthis section. Data from consumed events,and action execution results are added/mergedto state data. Reference the data merging section to learn about the merging rules that should be applied. The initial data input into a workflow instance. Must be a valid JSON object.If no input is provided, the default data input should be an empty JSON object: { } Workflow data input is passed to the workflow starting state as its data input. States in a workflow can receive data (data input) and produce a data result (data output). The state's data input is typically the previous state's data output.When a state completes its execution, its data output is passed to the state's data input it transitions to.There are two rules to consider here: If the state is the workflow starting state, its data input is the workflow data input. When Workflow Execution ends, the data output of the last executed state becomes the workflow data output. Each Workflow Execution should produce a data output.The workflow data output is the data output of the last executed workflow state. Parameter Description Type Required input Workflow expression to filter the states data input string no output Workflow expression that filters the states data output string no Click to view example definition JSON YAML "stateDataFilter": { "input": "${ .orders }", "output": "${ .provisionedOrders }" stateDataFilter: input: "${ .orders }" output: "${ .provisionedOrders }" State data filters can be used to filter the state's data input and output. The state data filters input property expression is applied when the workflow transitions to the current state and receives its data input.It can be used to select only data that is needed and disregard what is not needed.If input is not defined or does not select any parts of the state's data input, its data input is not filtered. The state data filter output property expression is applied right before the state transitions to the next state defined.It filters the state's data output to be passed as data input to the transitioning state.If the current state is the workflow end state, the filtered state's data output becomes the workflow data output.If output is not defined or does not select any parts of the state's data output, its data output is not filtered. Results of the input expression should become the state data input.Results of the output expression should become the state data output. For more information on this you can reference the data merging section. Let's take a look at some examples of state filters. For our examples let's say the data input to our state is as follows: "fruits": [ "apple", "orange", "pear" ], "vegetables": [ "veggieName": "potato", "veggieLike": true "veggieName": "broccoli", "veggieLike": false For the first example, our state only cares about fruits data, and we want to disregard the vegetables. To do thiswe can define a state filter: "stateDataFilter": { "input": "${ {fruits: .fruits} }" The state data output then would include only the fruits data: "fruits": [ "apple", "orange", "pear"] For our second example, let's say that we are interested in the only vegetable "veggie-like".Here we have two ways of filtering our data, depending on if actions within our state need access to all vegetables, oronly the ones that are "veggie-like". The first way would be to use both "input", and "output": "input": "${ {vegetables: .vegetables} }", "output": "${ {vegetables: [.vegetables[] | select(.veggieLike == true)]} }" The states data input filter selects all the vegetables from the main data input. Once all actions have performed, before the state transitionor Workflow Execution completion (if this is an end state), the "output" of the state filter selects only the vegetables which are "veggie like". The second way would be to directly filter only the "veggie like" vegetables with just the data input path: "input": "${ {vegetables: [.vegetables[] | select(.veggieLike == true)]} }" fromStateData Workflow expression that filters state data that can be used by the action string no useResults If set to false, action data results are not added/merged to state data. In this case 'results' and 'toStateData' should be ignored. Default is true. boolean no results Workflow expression that filters the actions data results string no toStateData Workflow expression that selects a state data element to which the action results should be added/merged into. If not specified denotes the top-level state data element string no "actionDataFilter": { "fromStateData": "${ .language }", "results": "${ .results.greeting }", "toStateData": "${ .finalgreeting }" actionDataFilter: fromStateData: "${ .language }" results: "${ .results.greeting }" toStateData: "${ .finalgreeting }" Action data filters can be used inside Action definitions.Each action can define this filter which can: Filter the state data to select only the data that can be used within function definition arguments using its fromStateData property. Filter the action results to select only the result data that should be added/merged back into the state datausing its results property. Select the part of state data which the action data results should be added/merged tousing the toStateData property. To give an example, let's say we have an action which returns a list of breads and pasta types.For our workflow, we are only interested into breads and not the pasta. Action results: "breads": ["baguette", "brioche", "rye"], "pasta": [ "penne", "spaghetti", "ravioli"] We can use an action data filter to filter only the breads data: "actions":[ "functionRef": "breadAndPastaTypesFunction", "actionDataFilter": { "results": "${ {breads: .breads} }" } ] The results will filter the action results, which would then be: "breads": [ "baguette", "brioche", "rye" Now let's take a look at a similar example (same expected action results) and assume our current state data is: "itemsToBuyAtStore": [ and have the following action definition: "results": "${ [ .breads[0], .pasta[1] ] }", "toStateData": "${ .itemsToBuyAtStore }" In this case, our results select the first bread and the second element of the pasta array.The toStateData expression then selects the itemsToBuyAtStore array of the state data to add/merge these resultsinto. With this, after our action executes the state data would be: "spaghetti" In the case action results should not be added/merged to state data, we can set the useResults property to false.In this case, the results and toStateData properties should be ignored, and nothing is added/merged to state data.If useResults is not specified (or it's value set to true), action results, if available, should be added/merged to state data. useData If set to false, event payload is not added/merged to state data. In this case 'data' and 'toStateData' should be ignored. Default is true. boolean no data Workflow expression that filters the event data (payload) string no "eventDataFilter": { "data": "${ .data.results }" eventDataFilter: data: "${ .data.results }" Event data filters can be used to filter consumed event payloads.They can be used to: Filter the event payload to select only the data that should be added/merged into the state datausing its data property. Select the part of state data into which the event payload should be added/merged intousing the toStateData property. Allows event data to be filtered and added to or merged with the state data. All events have to be in the CloudEvents formatand event data filters can filter both context attributes and the event payload (data) using the data property. Here is an example using an event filter: Note that the data input to the Event data filters depends on the dataOnly property of the associated Event definition.If this property is not defined (has default value of true), Event data filter expressions are evaluated against the event payload (the CloudEvents data attribute only). If it is set tofalse, the expressions should be evaluated against the entire CloudEvent (including its context attributes). In the case event data/payload should not be added/merged to state data, we can set the useData property to false.In this case, the data and toStateData properties should be ignored, and nothing is added/merged to state data.If useData is not specified (or it's value set to true), event payload, if available, should be added/merged to state data. As Event states can take advantage of all defined data filters. In the example below, we definea workflow with a single event state and show how data filters can be combined. "id": "GreetCustomersWorkflow", "name": "Greet Customers when they arrive", "version": "1.0.0", "specVersion": "0.8", "start": "WaitForCustomerToArrive", "states":[ { "name": "WaitForCustomerToArrive", "type": "event", "onEvents": [{ "eventRefs": ["CustomerArrivesEvent"], "eventDataFilter": { "data": "${ .customer }", "toStateData": "${ .customerInfo }" }, "actions":[ { "functionRef": { "refName": "greetingFunction", "arguments": { "greeting": "${ .hello.spanish } ", "customerName": "${ .customerInfo.name } " } }, "actionDataFilter": { "fromStateData": "${ { hello, customerInfo } }", "results": "${ .greetingMessageResult }", "toStateData": "${ .finalCustomerGreeting }" } } ] }], "stateDataFilter": { "input": "${ .greetings } ", "output": "${ { finalCustomerGreeting } }" }, "end": true "events": [{ "name": "CustomerArrivesEvent", "type": "customer-arrival-type", "source": "customer-arrival-event-source" }], "functions": [{ "name": "greetingFunction", "operation": "http://my.api.org/myapi.json#greeting" }] The workflow data input when starting Workflow Execution is assumed to include greetings in different languages: "greetings": { "hello": { "english": "Hello", "spanish": "Hola", "german": "Hallo", "russian": "" "goodbye": { "english": "Goodbye", "spanish": "Adis", "german": "Auf Wiedersehen", "russian": "" The workflow data input then becomes the data input of the starting workflow state. We also assume for this example that the CloudEvent that our event state consumes include the data (payload): "customer": { "name": "John Michaels", "address": "111 Some Street, SomeCity, SomeCountry", "age": 40 } Here is a sample diagram showing our workflow, each numbered step on this diagram shows a certain defined point duringWorkflow Execution at which data filters are invoked and correspond to the numbered items below. (1) Workflow execution starts: Workflow data is passed to our "WaitForCustomerToArrive" event state as data input.Workflow executes its starting state, namely the "WaitForCustomerToArrive" event state. The event state stateDataFilter is invoked to filter its data input. The filters "input" expression is evaluated andselects only the "greetings" data. The rest of the state data input should be disregarded. At this point our state data should be: "hello": { "english": "Hello", "spanish": "Hola", "german": "Hallo", "russian": "" "goodbye": { "english": "Goodbye", "spanish": "Adis", "german": "Auf Wiedersehen", "russian": "" (2) CloudEvent of type "customer-arrival-type" is consumed: Once the event is consumed, the "eventDataFilter" is triggered.Its "data" expression selects the "customer" object from the events data. The "toStateData" expressionsays that we should add/merge this selected event data to the state data in its "customerInfo" property. If this propertyexists it should be merged, if it does not exist, one should be created. At this point our state data contains: "hello": { "english": "Hello", "spanish": "Hola", "german": "Hallo", "russian": "" "goodbye": { "english": "Goodbye", "spanish": "Adis", "german": "Auf Wiedersehen", "russian": "" "customerInfo": { "name": "John Michaels", "address": "111 Some Street, SomeCity, SomeCountry", "age": 40 (3) Event state performs its actions:Before the first action is executed, its actionDataFilter is invoked. Its "fromStateData" expression filtersthe current state data to select from its data that should be available to action arguments. In this exampleit selects the "hello" and "customerInfo" properties from the current state data.At this point the action is executed.We assume that for this example "greetingFunction" returns: "execInfo": { "execTime": "10ms", "failures": false "greetingMessageResult": "Hola John Michaels!" After the action is executed, the actionDataFilter "results" expression is evaluated to filter the results returned from the action execution. In this case, we select only the "greetingMessageResult" element from the results. The action filters "toStateData" expression then defines that we want to add/merge this action result tostate data under the "finalCustomerGreeting" element. At this point, our state data contains: }, "finalCustomerGreeting": "Hola John Michaels!" (4) Event State Completes Execution: When our event state finishes its execution, the states "stateDataFilter" "output" filter expression is executedto filter the state data to create the final state data output. Because our event state is also an end state, its data output becomes the final workflow data output. Namely: "finalCustomerGreeting": "Hola John Michaels!" Consumed event data (payload) and action execution results should be merged into the state data.Event and action data filters can be used to give more details about this operation. By default, with no data filters specified, when an event is consumed, its entire data section (payload) should be mergedto the state data. Merging should be applied to the entire state data JSON element. In case of event and action filters, their "toStateData" property can be defined to select a specific elementof the state data with which merging should be done against. If this element does not exist, a new one shouldbe created first. When merging, the state data element and the data (payload)/action result should have the same type, meaningthat you should not merge arrays with objects or objects with arrays etc. When merging elements of type object should be done by inserting all the key-value pairs from both objects intoa single combined object. If both objects contain a value for the same key, the object of the event data/action resultsshould "win". To give an example, let's say we have the following state data: "customer": { "name": "John", "address": "1234 street", "zip": "12345" and we have the following event payload that needs to be merged into the state data: "zip": "54321" After merging the state data should be: "customer": { "name": "John", "address": "1234 street", "zip": "54321" Merging array types should be done by concatenating them into a larger array including unique elements of both arrays.To give an example, merging: "customers": [ "name": "Jane", "address": "4321 street", into state data: "name": "Michael", "address": "6789 street", "zip": "6789" should produce state data: Merging number types should be done by overwriting the data from events data/action results into the merging element of the state data.For example merging action results: "age": 30 "age": 20 would produce state data: Merging string types should be done by overwriting the data from events data/action results into the merging element of the state data. Workflow functions are reusable definitions for service invocations and/or expression evaluation.They can be referenced by their domain-specific names inside workflow states. Reference the following sections to learn more about workflow functions: Using functions for RESTful service invocations Using functions for gRPC service invocation Using functions for GraphQL service invocation Using functions for expression evaluations We can define if functions are invoked sync or async. Referencethe functionRef to learn more on how to do this. Functions can be used to describe services and their operations that need to be invoked duringWorkflow Execution. They can be referenced by states action definitions to clearlydefine when the service operations should be invoked during Workflow Execution, as well as the data parameterspassed to them if needed. Note that with Serverless Workflow, we can also define invocation of services which are triggered via an event.To learn more about that, please reference the event definitions section,as well as the actions definitions eventRef property. Because of an overall lack of a common way to describe different services and their operations,many workflow languages typically chose to define custom function definitions.This approach, however, often runs into issues such as lack of portability, limited capabilities, as well asforcing non-workflow-specific information, such as service authentication, to be added inside the workflow language. To avoid these issues, the Serverless Workflow specification mandates that details aboutRESTful services and their operations be described using the OpenAPI Specification.OpenAPI is a language-agnostic standard that describes discovery of RESTful services.This allows Serverless Workflow language to describe RESTful services in a portableway, as well as workflow runtimes to utilize OpenAPI tooling and APIs to invoke service operations. Here is an example function definition for a RESTful service operation. "functions": [ "name": "sendOrderConfirmation", "operation": "file://confirmationapi.json#sendOrderConfirmation" It can, as previously mentioned be referenced during Workflow Execution when the invocation of this service is desired.For example: "states": [ "name":"SendConfirmState", "type":"operation", "actions":[ { "functionRef": "sendOrderConfirmation" }], "end": true }] Note that the referenced function definition type in this case must be rest (default type). For more information about functions, reference the Functions definitions section. Functions can be used to invoke PUBLISH and SUBSCRIBE operations on a message broker documented by the Async API Specification.Async API operations are bound to a channel which describes the technology, security mechanisms, input and validation to be used for their execution. Let's take a look at a hypothetical Async API document (assumed its stored locally with the file name streetlightsapi.yaml) and define a single publish operation: asyncapi: 2.1.0 info: title: Streetlights API version: 1.0.0 description: | The Smartylighting Streetlights API allows you to remotely manage the city lights. license: name: Apache 2.0 url: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 servers: mosquitto: url: mqtt://test.mosquitto.org protocol: mqtt channels: light/measured: publish: summary: Inform about environmental lighting conditions for a particular streetlight. operationId: onLightMeasured message: name: LightMeasured payload: type: object properties: id: type: integer minimum: 0 description: Id of the streetlight. lumens: description: Light intensity measured in lumens. sentAt: type: string format: date-time description: Date and time when the message was sent. To define a workflow action invocation, we can then use the following workflow Function Definition and set the operation to onLightMeasured: "functions": [ "name": "publishLightMeasurements", "operation": "file://streetlightsapi.yaml#onLightMeasured", "type": "asyncapi" Note that the Function Definition's operation property must have the following format: <URI_to_asyncapi_file>#<OperationId> Also note that the referenced function definition type in this case must have the value asyncapi. Our defined function definition can then we referenced in a workflow action, for example: "name": "Publish Measurements", "type": "operation", "actions":[ "name": "Publish Light Measurements", "functionRef":{ "refName": "publishLightMeasurements", "arguments":{ "id": "${ .currentLight.id }", "lumens": "${ .currentLight.lumens }", "sentAt": "${ now }" Similar to defining invocations of operations on RESTful services, you can also use the workflowfunctions definitions that follow the remote procedure call (RPC) protocol.For RPC invocations, the Serverless Workflow specification mandates that they are described using gRPC,a widely used RPC system.gRPC uses Protocol Buffers to define messages, services,and the methods on those services that can be invoked. Let's look at an example of invoking a service method using RPC. For this example let's say we have the followinggRPC protocol buffer definition in a myuserservice.proto file: service UserService { rpc AddUser(User) returns (google.protobuf.Empty) { option (google.api.http) = { post: "/api/v1/users" body: "*" }; rpc ListUsers(ListUsersRequest) returns (stream User) { get: "/api/v1/users" rpc ListUsersByRole(UserRole) returns (stream User) { get: "/api/v1/users/role" rpc UpdateUser(UpdateUserRequest) returns (User) { patch: "/api/v1/users/{user.id}" In our workflow definition, we can then use function definitions: "name": "listUsers", "operation": "file://myuserservice.proto#UserService#ListUsers", "type": "rpc" Note that the operation property has the following format: <URI_to_proto_file>#<Service_Name>#<Service_Method_Name> Note that the referenced function definition type in this case must be rpc. If you want to use GraphQL services, you can also invoke them using a similar syntax to the above methods. We'll use the following GraphQL schema definition to show how that would work with both a query and a mutation: type Query { pets: [Pet] pet(id: Int!): Pet type Mutation { createPet(pet: PetInput!): Pet type Treat { id: Int! type Pet { name: String! favoriteTreat: Treat input PetInput { favoriteTreatId: Int INVOKING A GRAPHQL QUERY In our workflow definition, we can then use a function definition for the pet query field as such: "name": "getOnePet", "operation": "https://example.com/pets/graphql#query#pet", "type": "graphql" Note that the operation property has the following format for the graphql type: <url_to_graphql_endpoint>#<literal "mutation" or "query">#<mutation_or_query_field> In order to invoke this query, we would use the following functionRef parameters: "refName": "getOnePet", "arguments": { "id": 42 "selectionSet": "{ id, name, favoriteTreat { id } }" Which would return the following result: "pet": { "id": 42, "name": "Snuffles", "favoriteTreat": { "id": 9001 INVOKING A GRAPHQL MUTATION Likewise, we would use the following function definition: "name": "createPet", "operation": "https://example.com/pets/graphql#mutation#createPet", With the parameters for the functionRef: "refName": "createPet", "pet": { "id": 43, "name":"Sadaharu", "favoriteTreatId": 9001 Which would execute the mutation, creating the object and returning the following data: "id": 43, "name": "Sadaharu", Note you can include expressions in both arguments and selectionSet: "id": "${ .petId }" "selectionSet": "{ id, name, age(useDogYears: ${ .isPetADog }) { dateOfBirth, years } }" Expressions must be evaluated before executing the operation. Note that GraphQL Subscriptions are not supported at this time. Similar to defining invocations of operations on GraphQL services, you can also use workflowFunctions Definitions to execute complex queries on an OData service. CREATING AN ODATA FUNCTION DEFINITION We start off by creating a workflow Functions Definitions. For example: "name": "queryPersons", "operation": "https://services.odata.org/V3/OData/OData.svc#Persons", "type": "odata" Note that the operation property must follow the following format: <URI_to_odata_service>#<Entity_Set_Name> INVOKING AN ODATA FUNCTION DEFINITION In order to invoke the defined OData function,simply reference it in a workflow Action Definition and set its function arguments. For example: "refName": "queryPersons", "queryOptions":{ "expand": "PersonDetail/Person", "select": "Id, PersonDetail/Person/Name", "top": 5, "orderby": "PersonDetail/Person/Name" In order to ensure compatibility of OData support across runtimes,thearguments property of an OData function referenceshould follow the Serverless Workflow OData Json schema In addition to defining RESTful, AsyncAPI, RPC, GraphQL and OData services and their operations, workflow functions definitionscan also be used to define expressions that should be evaluated during Workflow Execution. Defining expressions as part of function definitions has the benefit of being able to referencethem by their logical name through workflow states where expression evaluation is required. Expression functions must declare their type parameter to be expression. Let's take a look at an example of such definitions: "name": "isAdult", "operation": ".applicant | .age >= 18", "type": "expression" "name": "isMinor", "operation": ".applicant | .age < 18", Here we define two reusable expression functions. Expressions in Serverless Workflowcan be evaluated against the workflow, or workflow state data. Note that different data filters play a big role as to which parts of theworkflow data are being evaluated by the expressions. Reference theState Data Filters section for more information on this. Our expression function definitions can now be referenced by workflow states when they need to be evaluated. For example: "states":[ "name":"CheckApplicant", "type":"switch", "dataConditions": [ { "name": "Applicant is adult", "condition": "${ fn:isAdult }", "transition": "ApproveApplication" }, "name": "Applicant is minor", "condition": "${ fn:isMinor }", "transition": "RejectApplication" "defaultCondition": { "transition": "RejectApplication" Our expression functions can also be referenced and executed as part of state action execution.Let's say we have the following workflow definition: "name": "simpleadd", "functions": [ "name": "Increment Count Function", "type": "expression", "operation": ".count += 1 | .count" "start": "Initialize Count", "states": [ "name": "Initialize Count", "type": "inject", "data": { "count": 0 "transition": "Increment Count" "name": "Increment Count", "type": "operation", "actions": [ { "functionRef": "Increment Count Function", "actionDataFilter": { "toStateData": "${ .count }" } ], The starting inject state "Initialize Count" injects the count element into our state data,which then becomes the state data input of our "Increment Count" operation state.This state defines an invocation of the "Increment Count Function" expression function defined in our workflow definition. This triggers the evaluation of the defined expression. The input of this expression is by default the current state data.Just like with "rest", and "rpc" type functions, expression functions also produce a result. In this casethe result of the expression is just the number 1.The actions filter then assigns this result to the state data element "count" and the state data becomes: "count": 1 Note that the used function definition type in this case must be expression. For more information about workflow expressions, reference the Workflow Expressions section. Function definitions type property defines a list of function types that are set bythe specification. Some runtime implementations might support additional function types that extend the onesdefined in the specification. In those cases you can define a custom function type with for example: "operation": "/path/to/my/script/order.ts#myFunction", "type": "custom" In this example we define a custom function type that is meant to execute an external TypeScript script. When a custom function type is specified, the operation property value has a custom format, meaning thatits format is controlled by the runtime which provides the custom function type. Later, the function should be able to be used in an action as any other function supported by the specification: [{ "states": [{ "name": "handleOrder", "type": "operation", "actions": [ "name": "sendOrderConfirmation", "functionRef": { "refName": "sendOrderConfirmation", "arguments": { "order": "${ .order }" } } "transition": "emailCustomer" }] Note that custom function types are not portable across runtimes. Workflow model parameters can use expressions to select/manipulate workflow and/or state data. Note that different data filters play a big role as to which parts of the states data are to be used when the expression isevaluated. Reference theState Data Filtering section for more information about state data filters. By default, all workflow expressions should be defined using the jq version 1.6 syntax.You can find more information on jq in its manual. Serverless Workflow does not mandate the use of jq and it's possible to use an expression languageof your choice with the restriction that a single one must be used for all expressionsin a workflow definition. If a different expression language needs to be used, make sure to set the workflowexpressionLang property to identify it to runtime implementations. Note that using a non-default expression language could lower the portability of your workflow definitionsacross multiple container/cloud platforms. All workflow expressions in this document, specification examples as well as comparisons examplesare written using the default jq syntax. Workflow expressions have the following format: ${ expression } Where expression can be either an in-line expression, or a reference to adefined expression function definition. To reference a defined expression function definitionthe expression must have the following format, for example: ${ fn:myExprFuncName } Where fn is the namespace of the defined expression functions andmyExprName is the unique expression function name. To show some expression examples, let's say we have the following state data: "applicant": { "name": "John Doe", "age" : 26, "email": "johndoe@something.com", "address" : { "streetAddress": "Naist street", "city" : "Nara", "postalCode" : "630-0192" "phoneNumbers": [ "type" : "iPhone", "number": "0123-4567-8888" "type" : "home", "number": "0123-4567-8910" In our workflow model we can define our reusable expression function: "name": "IsAdultApplicant", "operation": ".applicant | .age > 18", We will get back to this function definition in just a bit, but now let's take a look at usingan inline expression that sets an input parameter inside an action for example: "actions": [ "functionRef": { "refName": "confirmApplicant", "applicantName": "${ .applicant.name }" In this case our input parameter applicantName would be set to "John Doe". Expressions can also be used to select and manipulate state data, this is in particularly useful forstate data filters. For example let's use another inline expression: "stateDataFilter": { "output": "${ .applicant | {applicant: .name, contactInfo: { email: .email, phone: .phoneNumbers }} }" This would set the data output of the particular state to: "applicant": "John Doe", "contactInfo": { "phone": [ "type": "iPhone", "type": "home", Switch state conditions require for expressions to be resolved to a boolean value (true/false). We can now get back to our previously defined "IsAdultApplicant" expression function and reference it: "dataConditions": [ { "condition": "${ fn:IsAdultApplicant }", "transition": "StartApplication" As previously mentioned, expressions are evaluated against certain subsets of data. For examplethe parameters param of the functionRef definition can evaluate expressionsonly against the data that is available to the action it belongs to.One thing to note here are the top-level workflow definition parameters. Expressions definedin them can only be evaluated against the initial workflow data input. For example let's say that we have a workflow data input of: "inputVersion" : "1.0.0" we can use this expression in the workflow "version" parameter: "id": "MySampleWorkflow", "name": "Sample Workflow", "version": "${ .inputVersion }", "specVersion": "0.8" which would set the workflow version to "1.0.0".Note that the workflow "id" property value is not allowed to use an expression. The workflowdefinition "id" must be a constant value. id Workflow unique identifier string yes (if key is not defined) key Domain-specific workflow identifier string yes (if id is not defined) name Workflow name string no description Workflow description string no version Workflow version. MUST respect the semantic versioning format string no annotations List of helpful terms describing the workflows intended purpose, subject areas, or other important qualities array no dataInputSchema Used to validate the workflow data input against a defined JSON Schema string or object no dataOutputSchema Used to validate the workflow data output against a defined JSON Schema string or object no constants Workflow constants string or object no secrets Workflow secrets string or array no start Workflow start definition string or object no specVersion Serverless Workflow specification release version string yes expressionLang Identifies the expression language used for workflow expressions. Default value is "jq" string no timeouts Defines the workflow default timeout settings string or object no errors Defines checked errors that can be explicitly handled during Workflow Execution string or array no keepActive If true, workflow instances is not terminated when there are no active execution paths. Instance can be terminated with "terminate end definition" or reaching defined "workflowExecTimeout" boolean no auth Workflow authentication definitions array or string no events Workflow event definitions. array or string no functions Workflow function definitions. Can be either inline function definitions (if array) or URI pointing to a resource containing json/yaml function definitions (if string) array or string no autoRetries If set to true, actions should automatically be retried on unchecked errors. Default is false boolean no retries Workflow retries definitions. Can be either inline retries definitions (if array) or URI pointing to a resource containing json/yaml retry definitions (if string) array or string no states Workflow states array yes extensions Workflow extensions definitions array or string no metadata Metadata information object no "id": "sampleWorkflow", "version": "1.0.0", "specVersion": "0.8", "description": "Sample Workflow", "start": "MyStartingState", "states": [], "functions": [], "events": [], "errors": [], "retries":[] id: sampleWorkflow version: '1.0.0' specVersion: '0.8' name: Sample Workflow description: Sample Workflow start: MyStartingState states: [] functions: [] events: [] errors: [] retries: [] Defines the top-level structure of a serverless workflow model.Following figure describes the main workflow definition blocks. The id property defines the unique, domain-specific workflow identifier, for example "orders", "payment", etc. The key property defines the unique, domain-specific workflow identifier.It can be used when the id property is auto-generated by a content-management system for example.In these cases, you can specify the key property to be the domain-specific identifier of the workflow definition.The id and key properties are mutually exclusive, meaning you cannot define both. The name property is the workflow logical name. The description property can be used to give further information about the workflow. The version property can be used to provide a specific workflow version. It must use the semantic versioning format. The annotations property defines a list of helpful terms describing the workflows intended purpose, subject areas, or other important qualities,for example "machine learning", "monitoring", "networking", etc The dataInputSchema and dataOutputSchema properties can be used to validate input and output data against a defined JSON Schema. The dataInputSchema property validates the workflow data input. Validation should be performed before any states are executed. In case ofa start Event state the input schema is ignored, if present. The failOnValidationErrors property determines if Workflow Execution should continue in case of validation errors. The dataOutputSchema property validates the Workflow data output. Validation is performed on the output of the Workflow Execution.The failOnValidationErrors property determines what should be done when the workflow output does not match the provided schema.If failOnValidationErrors is true, an error should be thrown. If executed within a subprocess, that error can be be handled by the parent workflow.If failOnValidationErrors is false, the error should not be propagated. It is up to the implementor to warn the user about that fact. For example, printing a log. Both properties can be expressed as object or string type. If using object type, their schema property might be an URI, which points to the JSON schema used to validate the workflow data input, or it might be the JSON schema object. failOnValidationErrors is optional, default value is true. Example for Json schema reference "dataInputSchema": { "schema": "URI to json schema", "failOnValidationErrors": false Example for Json schema included in the workflow file "dataOutputSchema": { "schema": { "title": "MyJSONSchema", "properties":{ "firstName":{ "type": "string" }, "lastName":{ "failOnValidationErrors": true If using string type, then the string value is the external schema URI and failOnValidationErrors default value of true is assumed. Example using string type "dataInputSchema": "URI_to_json_schema" The secrets property allows you to use sensitive information such as passwords, OAuth tokens, ssh keys, etc. inside yourWorkflow expressions. It has two possible types, string or array.If string type, it is an URI pointing to a JSON or YAML documentwhich contains an array of names of the secrets, for example: "secrets": "file://workflowsecrets.json" If array type, it defines an array (of string types) which contains the names of the secrets, for example: "secrets": ["MY_PASSWORD", "MY_STORAGE_KEY", "MY_ACCOUNT"] For more information about Workflow secrets, reference the Workflow Secrets section. The constants property can be used to define Workflow constants valueswhich are accessible in Workflow Expressions. It has two possible types, string or object.If string type, it is an URI pointing to a JSON or YAML documentwhich contains an object of global definitions, for example: "constants": "file://workflowconstants.json" If object type, it defines a JSON object which contains the constants definitions, for example: "AGE": { "MIN_ADULT": 18 For more information see the Workflow Constants section. The start property defines the workflow starting information. For more information see the start definition section.This property is not required. If not defined, the workflow starting state has to bethe very first state defined in the workflow states array. The specVersion property is used to set the Serverless Workflow specification release versionthe workflow markup adheres to.It has to follow the specification release versions (excluding the leading "v"), meaning that forthe release version v0.8its value should be set to "0.8". The expressionLang property can be used to identify the expression language used for all expressions inthe workflow definition. The default value of this property is "jq".You should set this property if you chose to define workflow expressionswith an expression language / syntax other than the default. The timeouts property is used to define the default workflow timeouts for workflow, state, action, and branchexecution. For more information about timeouts and its use cases see the Workflow Timeouts section. The error property is used to define checked errors that can be explicitly handled during Workflow Execution.For more information about workflow error handling see this section. The auth property can be either an inline auth definition array, or a URI reference toa resource containing an array of auth definitions.If defined in a separate resource file (Json or Yaml), auth definitions can be re-used by multiple workflow definitions.Auth definitions can be used to define authentication that should be used to accessthe resource defined in the operation property of the function definitions.If we have the following function definition: "functions": [ "name": "HelloWorldFunction", "operation": "https://secure.resources.com/myapi.json#helloWorld", "authRef": "My Basic Auth" The authRef property is used to reference an authentication definition inthe auth property and should be applied when invoking the helloWorld function. An AuthRef object can alternatively be used to configure the authentication definition to use when accessing the function's resource and/or when invoking the function. The functions property can be either an in-line function definition array, or an URI reference toa resource containing an array of functions definition.Referenced resource can be used by multiple workflow definitions. Here is an example of using external resource for function definitions: Workflow definition: "functions": "http://myhost:8080/functiondefs.json", "states":[ ... Function definitions resource: "name":"HelloWorldFunction", "operation":"file://myapi.json#helloWorld" Referenced resource must conform to the specifications Workflow Functions JSON Schema. The events property can be either an in-line event definition array, or an URI reference toa resource containing an array of event definition. Referenced resource can be used by multiple workflow definitions. Here is an example of using external resource for event definitions: "events": "http://myhost:8080/eventsdefs.json", Event definitions resource: "events": [ "name": "ApplicantInfo", "type": "org.application.info", "source": "applicationssource", "correlation": [ { "contextAttributeName": "applicantId" ] Referenced resource must conform to the specifications Workflow Events JSON Schema. The retries property can be either an in-line retry definition array, or an URI reference toa resource containing an array of retry definition.Referenced resource can be used by multiple workflow definitions. For more information aboutusing and referencing retry definitions see the Workflow Error Handling section. The keepActive property allows you to change the default behavior of workflow instances.By default, as described in the Core Concepts section, a workflow instance is terminated once there are no moreactive execution paths, one of its active paths ends in a "terminate" end definition, or whenits workflowExecTimeout time is reached. Setting the keepActive property to true allows you to change this default behavior in that a workflow instancecreated from this workflow definition can only be terminated if one of its active paths ends in a "terminate" end definition, or whenits workflowExecTimeout time is reached.This allows you to explicitly model workflows where an instance should be kept alive, to collect (event) data for example. You can reference the specification examples to see the keepActive property in action. The extensions property can be used to define extensions for this workflow definition.You can learn more about workflow extensions in the Extensions section.Sample extensions property definition could look like this for example: "extensions": [ "extensionId": "workflow-ratelimiting-extension", "path": "file://myextensions/ratelimiting.yml" "extensionId": "workflow-kpi-extension", "path": "file://myextensions/kpi.yml" Here we define two workflow extensions, namely the rate limiting and kpi extensions for our workflow definition. Workflow states define building blocks of the Workflow Execution instructions. They define thecontrol flow logic instructions on what the workflow is supposed to do.Serverless Workflow defines the following Workflow States: Name Description Consumes events? Produces events? Executes actions? Handles errors/retries? Allows parallel execution? Makes data-based transitions? Can be workflow start state? Can be workflow end state? Event Define events that trigger action execution yes yes yes yes yes no yes yes Operation Execute one or more actions no yes yes yes yes no yes yes Switch Define data-based or event-based workflow transitions no yes no yes no yes yes no Sleep Sleep Workflow Execution for a specific time duration no yes no yes no no yes yes Parallel Causes parallel execution of branches (set of states) no yes no yes yes no yes yes Inject Inject static data into state data no yes no yes no no yes yes ForEach Parallel execution of states for each element of a data array no yes no yes yes no yes yes Callback Manual decision step. Executes a function and waits for callback event that indicates completion of the manual decision yes yes yes yes no no yes yes EVENT STATE name Unique State name string yes type State type string yes exclusive If true, consuming one of the defined events causes its associated actions to be performed. If false, all of the defined events must be consumed in order for actions to be performed. Default is true boolean no onEvents Define the events to be consumed and optional actions to be performed array yes timeouts State specific timeout settings object no stateDataFilter State data filter definition object no transition Next transition of the workflow after all the actions have been performed string or object yes (if end is not defined) onErrors States error handling definitions array no end Is this state an end state boolean or object yes (if transition is not defined) compensatedBy Unique name of a workflow state which is responsible for compensation of this state string no "name": "MonitorVitals", "type": "event", "exclusive": true, "onEvents": [{ "eventRefs": ["HighBodyTemperature"], "actions": [{ "functionRef": { "refName": "sendTylenolOrder", "arguments": { "patientid": "${ .patientId }" }] "eventRefs": ["HighBloodPressure"], "refName": "callNurse", "eventRefs": ["HighRespirationRate"], "refName": "callPulmonologist", "end": { "terminate": true name: MonitorVitals type: event exclusive: true onEvents: - eventRefs: - HighBodyTemperature actions: - functionRef: refName: sendTylenolOrder arguments: patientid: "${ .patientId }" - HighBloodPressure refName: callNurse - HighRespirationRate refName: callPulmonologist end: terminate: true Event states await one or more events and perform actions when they are received.If defined as the workflow starting state, the event state definition controls when the workflowinstances should be created. The exclusive property determines if the state should wait for any of the defined events in the onEvents array, orif all defined events must be present for their associated actions to be performed. Following two figures illustrate the exclusive property: If the Event state in this case is a workflow starting state, the occurrence of any of the defined events would start a new workflow instance. If the Event state in this case is a workflow starting state, the occurrence of all defined events would start a newworkflow instance. In order to consider only events that are related to each other, we need to set the correlation property in the workflowevents definitions. This allows us to set up event correlation rules against the eventsextension context attributes. If the Event state is not a workflow starting state, the timeout property can be used to define the time duration from theinvocation of the event state. If the defined event, or events have not been received during this time,the state should transition to the next state or can end the Workflow Execution (if it is an end state). The timeouts property can be used to define state specific timeout settings. Event states can define thestateExecTimeout, actionExecTimeout, and eventTimeout properties.For more information about Event state specific event timeout settings reference this section.For more information about workflow timeouts reference the Workflow Timeouts section. Note that transition and end properties are mutually exclusive, meaning that you cannot define both of them at the same time. OPERATION STATE actionMode Should actions be performed sequentially or in parallel. Default is sequential enum no actions Actions to be performed array yes stateDataFilter State data filter object no onErrors States error handling and retries definitions array no usedForCompensation If true, this state is used to compensate another state. Default is false boolean no "name": "RejectApplication", "type": "operation", "actionMode": "sequential", "actions": [ "refName": "sendRejectionEmailFunction", "customer": "${ .customer }" "end": true name: RejectApplication type: operation actionMode: sequential actions: - functionRef: refName: sendRejectionEmailFunction arguments: customer: "${ .customer }" end: true Operation state defines a set of actions to be performed in sequence or in parallel.Once all actions have been performed, a transition to another state can occur. The timeouts property can be used to define state specific timeout settings. Operation states can definethe stateExecTimeout and actionExecTimeout settings. For more information on Workflow timeouts referencethe Workflow Timeouts section. SWITCH STATE dataConditions Defined if the Switch state evaluates conditions and transitions based on state data. array yes (if eventConditions is not defined) eventConditions Defined if the Switch state evaluates conditions and transitions based on arrival of events. array yes (if dataConditions is not defined defaultCondition Default transition of the workflow if there is no matching data conditions or event timeout is reached. Can be a transition or end definition object yes "name":"CheckVisaStatus", "eventConditions": [ "eventRef": "visaApprovedEvent", "transition": "HandleApprovedVisa" "eventRef": "visaRejectedEvent", "transition": "HandleRejectedVisa" "timeouts": { "eventTimeout": "PT1H" "transition": "HandleNoVisaDecision" name: CheckVisaStatus type: switch eventConditions: - eventRef: visaApprovedEvent transition: HandleApprovedVisa - eventRef: visaRejectedEvent transition: HandleRejectedVisa timeouts: eventTimeout: PT1H defaultCondition: transition: HandleNoVisaDecision Switch states can be viewed as workflow gateways: they can direct transitions of a workflow based on certain conditions.There are two types of conditions for switch states: Data-based conditions Event-based conditions These are exclusive, meaning that a switch state can define one or the other condition type, but not both. At times multiple defined conditions can be evaluated to true by runtime implementations.Conditions defined first take precedence over conditions defined later. This is backed by the fact that arrays/sequencesare ordered in both JSON and YAML. For example, let's say there are two true conditions: A and B, defined in that order.Because A was defined first, its transition will be executed, not B's. In case of data-based conditions definition, switch state controls workflow transitions based on the states data.If no defined conditions can be matched, the state transitions is taken based on the defaultCondition property.This property can be either a transition to another workflow state, or an end definition meaning a workflow end. For event-based conditions, a switch state acts as a workflow wait state. It halts Workflow Executionuntil one of the referenced events arrive, then making a transition depending on that event definition.If events defined in event-based conditions do not arrive before the states eventTimeout property expires,state transitions are based on the defined defaultCondition property. The timeouts property can be used to define state specific timeout settings. Switch states can define thestateExecTimeout setting. If eventConditions is defined, the switch state can also define theeventTimeout property. For more information on workflow timeouts reference the Workflow Timeouts section. SLEEP STATE duration Duration (ISO 8601 duration format) to sleep. For example: "PT15M" (sleep 15 minutes), or "P2DT3H4M" (sleep 2 days, 3 hours and 4 minutes) string yes transition Next transition of the workflow after the sleep string or object yes (if end is not defined) "name": "SleepFiveSeconds", "type": "sleep", "duration": "PT5S", "transition": "GetJobStatus" name: SleepFiveSeconds type: sleep duration: PT5S transition: GetJobStatus Sleep statesuspends Workflow Execution for a given time duration. The delay is defined in its duration property using the ISO 8601duration format. PARALLEL STATE branches List of branches for this parallel state array yes completionType Option types on how to complete branch execution. Default is "allOf" enum no numCompleted Used when branchCompletionType is set to atLeast to specify the least number of branches that must complete in order for the state to transition/end. string or number yes (if completionType is atLeast) transition Next transition of the workflow after all branches have completed execution string or object yes (if end is not defined) { "name":"ParallelExec", "type":"parallel", "completionType": "allOf", "branches": [ "name": "Branch1", "actions": [ { "functionRef": { "refName": "functionNameOne", "arguments": { "order": "${ .someParam }" "name": "Branch2", { "functionRef": { "refName": "functionNameTwo", "arguments": { "order": "${ .someParam }" } } } ] "end": true name: ParallelExec type: parallel completionType: allOf branches: - name: Branch1 refName: functionNameOne order: "${ .someParam }" - name: Branch2 refName: functionNameTwo Parallel state defines a collection of branches that are executed in parallel.A parallel state can be seen a state which splits up the current workflow instance execution pathinto multiple ones, one for each branch. These execution paths are performed in paralleland are joined back into the current execution path depending on the defined completionType parameter value. The "completionType" enum specifies the different ways of completing branch execution: allOf: All branches must complete execution before the state can transition/end. This is the default value in case this parameter is not defined in the parallel state definition. atLeast: State can transition/end once at least the specified number of branches have completed execution. In this case you must alsospecify the numCompleted property to define this number. Exceptions may occur during execution of branches of the Parallel state, this is described in detail in this section. The timeouts property can be used to set state specific timeout settings. Parallel states can define thestateExecTimeout and branchExecTimeout timeout settings. For more information on workflow timeoutsreference the Workflow Timeouts section. INJECT STATE data JSON object which can be set as state's data input and can be manipulated via filter object yes transition Next transition of the workflow after injection has completed string or object yes (if end is not defined) "name":"Hello", "type":"inject", "data": { "result": "Hello" "transition": "World" name: Hello type: inject data: result: Hello transition: World Inject state can be used to inject static data into state data input. Inject state does not perform any actions.It is very useful for debugging, for example, as you can test/simulate Workflow Execution with pre-set data that would typicallybe dynamic in nature (e.g., function calls, events). The inject state data property allows you to statically define a JSON object which gets added to the states data input.You can use the filter property to control the states data output to the transition state. Here is a typical example of how to use the inject state to add static data into its states data input, which then is passedas data output to the transition state: "name":"SimpleInjectState", "type":"inject", "data": { "person": { "fname": "John", "lname": "Doe", "address": "1234 SomeStreet", "age": 40 }, "transition": "GreetPersonState" name: SimpleInjectState type: inject data: person: fname: John lname: Doe address: 1234 SomeStreet age: 40 transition: GreetPersonState The data output of the "SimpleInjectState" which then is passed as input to the transition state would be: "person": { If the inject state already receives a data input from the previous transition state, the inject data should be mergedwith its data input. You can also use the filter property to filter the state data after data is injected. Let's say we have: "name":"SimpleInjectState", "people": [ "fname": "John", "lname": "Doe", "address": "1234 SomeStreet", "age": 40 }, "fname": "Marry", "lname": "Allice", "age": 25 "fname": "Kelly", "lname": "Mill", "age": 30 "stateDataFilter": { "output": "${ {people: [.people[] | select(.age < 40)]} }" "transition": "GreetPersonState" people: - fname: John - fname: Marry lname: Allice age: 25 - fname: Kelly lname: Mill age: 30 stateDataFilter: output: "${ {people: [.people[] | select(.age < 40)]} }" In which case the states data output would include only people whose age is less than 40: "people": [ "fname": "Marry", "lname": "Allice", "age": 25 "fname": "Kelly", "lname": "Mill", "age": 30 You can change your output path easily during testing, for example change the expression to: ${ {people: [.people[] | select(.age >= 40)]} } This allows you to test if your workflow behaves properly for cases when there are people whose age is greater or equal 40. FOREACH STATE inputCollection Workflow expression selecting an array element of the states data string yes outputCollection Workflow expression specifying an array element of the states data to add the results of each iteration string no iterationParam Name of the iteration parameter that can be referenced in actions/workflow. For each parallel iteration, this param should contain an unique element of the inputCollection array string no batchSize Specifies how many iterations may run in parallel at the same time. Used if mode property is set to parallel (default). If not specified, its value should be the size of the inputCollection string or number no mode Specifies how iterations are to be performed (sequentially or in parallel). Default is parallel enum no actions Actions to be executed for each of the elements of inputCollection array yes transition Next transition of the workflow after state has completed string or object yes (if end is not defined) "name": "ProvisionOrdersState", "type": "foreach", "inputCollection": "${ .orders }", "iterationParam": "singleorder", "outputCollection": "${ .provisionresults }", "refName": "provisionOrderFunction", "order": "${ $singleorder }" name: ProvisionOrdersState type: foreach inputCollection: "${ .orders }" iterationParam: "singleorder" outputCollection: "${ .provisionresults }" refName: provisionOrderFunction order: "${ $singleorder }" ForEach states can be used to execute actions for each element of a data set. Each iteration of the ForEach state is by default executed in parallel by default.However, executing iterations sequentially is also possible by setting the value of the mode property tosequential. The mode property defines if iterations should be done sequentially or in parallel. By default,if mode is not specified, iterations should be done in parallel. If the default parallel iteration mode is used, the batchSize property to the number of iterations (batch)that can be executed at a time. To give an example, if the number of iterations is 55 and batchSizeis set to 10, 10 iterations are to be executed at a time, meaning that the state would execute 10 iterations in parallel,then execute the next batch of 10 iterations. After 5 such executions, the remaining 5 iterations are to be executed in the last batch.The batch size value must be greater than 1. If not specified, its value should be the size of the inputCollection (all iterations). The inputCollection property is a workflow expression which selects an array in the states data. All iterationsare performed against data elements of this array. If this array does not exist, the runtime should throwan error. This error can be handled inside the states onErrors definition. The outputCollection property is a workflow expression which selects an array in the state data where the resultsof each iteration should be added to. If this array does not exist, it should be created. The iterationParam property defines the name of the iteration parameter passed to each iteration of the ForEach state.It should contain the unique element of the inputCollection array and made available to actions of the ForEach state.iterationParam can be accessed as an expression variable. In JQ, expression variables are prefixed by $.If iterationParam is not explicitly defined, runtimes should create one and populate it with the value of the uniqueiteration parameter for each iteration of the ForEach state. The actions property defines actions to be executed in each state iteration. Let's take a look at an example: In this example the data input to our workflow is an array of orders: "orders": [ "orderNumber": "1234", "completed": true, "email": "firstBuyer@buyer.com" "orderNumber": "5678", "email": "secondBuyer@buyer.com" "orderNumber": "9910", "completed": false, "email": "thirdBuyer@buyer.com" and our workflow is defined as: "id": "sendConfirmWorkflow", "name": "SendConfirmationForCompletedOrders", "version": "1.0.0", "specVersion": "0.8", "start": "SendConfirmState", "name": "sendConfirmationFunction", "states": [ "type":"foreach", "inputCollection": "${ [.orders[] | select(.completed == true)] }", "iterationParam": "completedorder", "outputCollection": "${ .confirmationresults }", "functionRef": { "refName": "sendConfirmationFunction", "arguments": { "orderNumber": "${ $completedorder.orderNumber }", "email": "${ $completedorder.email }" } id: sendConfirmWorkflow name: SendConfirmationForCompletedOrders start: SendConfirmState functions: - name: sendConfirmationFunction operation: file://confirmationapi.json#sendOrderConfirmation states: - name: SendConfirmState type: foreach inputCollection: "${ [.orders[] | select(.completed == true)] }" iterationParam: completedorder outputCollection: "${ .confirmationresults }" refName: sendConfirmationFunction orderNumber: "${ $completedorder.orderNumber }" email: "${ $completedorder.email }" end: true The workflow data input containing order information is passed to the SendConfirmState ForEach state.The ForEach state defines an inputCollection property which selects all orders that have the completed property set to true. For each element of the array selected by inputCollection a JSON object defined by iterationParam should becreated containing an unique element of inputCollection and passed as the data input to the parallel executed actions. So for this example, we would have two parallel executions of the sendConfirmationFunction, the first one having data: "completedorder": { "orderNumber": "1234", "completed": true, "email": "firstBuyer@buyer.com" and the second: "orderNumber": "5678", "email": "secondBuyer@buyer.com" The results of each parallel action execution are stored as elements in the state data array defined by the outputCollection property. The timeouts property can be used to set state specific timeout settings. ForEach states can define thestateExecTimeout and actionExecTimeout settings. For more information on workflow timeouts reference the Workflow Timeoutssection. CALLBACK STATE action Defines the action to be executed object yes eventRef References an unique callback event name in the defined workflow events string yes eventDataFilter Callback event data filter definition object no transition Next transition of the workflow after callback event has been received string or object yes (if end is not defined) compensatedBy Uniaue name of a workflow state which is responsible for compensation of this state string no "name": "CheckCredit", "type": "callback", "action": { "refName": "callCreditCheckMicroservice", "eventRef": "CreditCheckCompletedEvent", "timeouts": { "stateExecTimeout": "PT15M" "transition": "EvaluateDecision" name: CheckCredit type: callback action: functionRef: refName: callCreditCheckMicroservice eventRef: CreditCheckCompletedEvent stateExecTimeout: PT15M transition: EvaluateDecision Serverless orchestration can at times require manual steps/decisions to be made. While some work performedin a serverless workflow can be executed automatically, some decisions must involve manual steps (e.g., human decisions).The Callback state allows you to explicitly model manual decision steps during Workflow Execution. The action property defines a function call that triggers an external activity/service. Once the action executes,the callback state will wait for a CloudEvent (defined via the eventRef property), which indicates the completionof the manual decision by the called service. Note that the called decision service is responsible for emitting the callback CloudEvent indicating the completion of thedecision and including the decision results as part of the event payload. This event must be correlated to theworkflow instance using the callback events context attribute defined in the correlation property of thereferenced Event Definition. Once the completion (callback) event is received, the Callback state completes its execution and transitions to the nextdefined workflow state or completes Workflow Execution in case it is an end state. The callback event payload is merged with the Callback state data and can be filtered via the "eventDataFilter" definition. If the defined callback event has not been received during this time period, the state should transition to the next state or end Workflow Execution if it is an end state. The timeouts property defines state specific timeout settings. Callback states can define thestateExecTimeout, actionExecTimeout, and eventTimeout properties.For more information on workflow timeouts reference the Workflow Timeoutssection. FUNCTION DEFINITION name Unique function name string yes operation If type is rest, #. If type is asyncapi, #. If type is rpc, ##. If type is graphql, #<literal "mutation" or "query">#. If type is odata, #. If type is expression, defines the workflow expression. string yes type Defines the function type. Can be either rest, asyncapi, rpc, graphql, odata, expression, or custom. Default is rest enum no authRef References an auth definition name to be used to access to resource defined in the operation parameter string no metadata Metadata information. Can be used to define custom function information object no "name": "HelloWorldFunction", "operation": "https://hellworldservice.api.com/api.json#helloWorld" name: HelloWorldFunction operation: https://hellworldservice.api.com/api.json#helloWorld The name property defines an unique name of the function definition. The type property defines the function type. Its value can be either rest or expression. Default value is rest. Depending on the function type, the operation property can be: If type is rest, a combination of the function/service OpenAPI definition document URI and the particular service operation that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'.For example https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json#getPetById. If type is asyncapi, a combination of the AsyncApi definition document URI and the particular service operation that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'.For example file://streetlightsapi.yaml#onLightMeasured. If type is rpc, a combination of the gRPC proto document URI and the particular service name and service method name that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'.For example file://myuserservice.proto#UserService#ListUsers. If type is graphql, a combination of the GraphQL schema definition URI and the particular service name and service method name that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'.For example file://myuserservice.proto#UserService#ListUsers. If type is odata, a combination of the GraphQL schema definition URI and the particular service name and service method name that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'.For example https://services.odata.org/V3/OData/OData.svc#Products. If type is expression, defines the expression syntax. Take a look at the workflow expressions section for more information on this. Defining custom function types is possible, for more information on that refer to the Defining custom function types section. The authRef property references a name of a defined workflow auth definition.It is used to provide authentication info to access the resource defined in the operation property and/or to invoke the function. The metadata property allows users to define custom information to function definitions.This allows you for example to define functions that describe of a command executions on a Docker image: - name: whalesayimage metadata: image: docker/whalesay command: cowsay Note that using metadata for cases such as above heavily reduces the portability of your workflow markup. Function definitions themselves do not define data input parameters. Parameters can bedefined via the parameters property in function definitions inside actions. AuthRef Definition resource References an auth definition to be used to access the resource defined in the operation parameter string yes invocation References an auth definition to be used to invoke the operation string no The authRef property references a name of a defined workflow auth definition. It can be a string or an object. If it's a string, the referenced auth definition is used solely for the function's invocation. If it's an object, it is possible to specify an auth definition to use for the function's resource retrieval (as defined by the operation property) and another for its invocation. Example of a function definition configured to use an auth definition called "My Basic Auth" upon invocation: - name: SecuredFunctionInvocation operation: https://test.com/swagger.json#HelloWorld authRef: My Basic Auth Example of a function definition configured to use an auth definition called "My Basic Auth" to retrieve the resource defined by the operation property, and an auth definition called "My OIDC Auth" upon invocation: authRef: resource: My Basic Auth invocation: My OIDC Auth Note that if multiple functions share the same operation path (which is the first component of the operation value, located before the first '#' character), and if one of them defines an auth definition for resource access, then it should always be used to access said resource.In other words, when retrieving the resource of the function "MySecuredFunction2" defined in the following example, the "My Api Key Auth" auth definition should be used, because the "MySecuredFunction1" has defined it for resource access.This is done to avoid unnecessary repetitions of auth definition configuration when using the same resource for multiple defined functions. - name: MySecuredFunction1 operation: https://secure.resources.com/myapi.json#helloWorld authRef: resource: My ApiKey Auth - name: MySecuredFunction2 operation: https://secure.resources.com/myapi.json#holaMundo It's worth noting that if an auth definition has been defined for an OpenAPI function which's resource declare an authentication mechanism, the later should be used instead, thus ignoring entirely the auth definition. EVENT DEFINITION name Unique event name string yes source CloudEvent source. If not set when kind is produced, runtimes are expected to use a default value, such as https://serverlessworkflow.io in order to comply with the CloudEvent spec constraints) string yes (if type is not defined. type CloudEvent type string yes (if source is not defined) kind Defines the event is either consumed or produced by the workflow. Default is consumed enum no correlation Define event correlation rules for this event. Only used for consumed events array no dataOnly If true (default value), only the Event payload is accessible to consuming Workflow states. If false, both event payload and context attributes should be accessible boolean no "name": "ApplicantInfo", "type": "org.application.info", "source": "applicationssource", "kind": "consumed", "correlation": [ "contextAttributeName": "applicantId" name: ApplicantInfo type: org.application.info source: applicationssource kind: consumed correlation: - contextAttributeName: applicantId Used to define events and their correlations. These events can be either consumed or produced during Workflow Execution as wellas can be used to trigger function/service invocations. The Serverless Workflow specification mandates that all events conform to the CloudEvents specification.This is to assure consistency and portability of the events format used. The name property defines a single name of the event that is unique inside the workflow definition. This event name can bethen referenced within function and state definitions. The source property matches this event definition with the sourceproperty of the CloudEvent required attributes. The type property matches this event definition with the type property of the CloudEvent required attributes. The kind property defines this event as either consumed or produced. In terms of the workflow, this means it is either an eventthat triggers workflow instance creation, or continuation of workflow instance execution (consumed), or an eventthat the workflow instance creates during its execution (produced).The default value (if not specified) of the kind property is consumed.Note that for produced event definitions, implementations must provide the value of the CloudEvent source attribute.In this case (i.e., when the kind property is set to produced), the source property of the event is not required in the workflow definition.Otherwise, (i.e., when the kind property is set to consumed), the source property must be defined in the event definition. Event correlation plays a big role in large event-driven applications. Correlating one or more events with a particular workflow instancecan be done by defining the event correlation rules within the correlation property.This property is an array of correlation definitions.The CloudEvents specification allows users to add Extension Context Attributesand the correlation definitions can use these attributes to define clear matching event correlation rules.Extension context attributes are not part of the event payload, so they are serialized the same way as other standard required attributes.This means that the event payload does not have to be inspected by implementations in order to read and evaluate the defined correlation rules. Let's take a look at an example. Here we have two events that have an extension context attribute called "patientId" (as well as "department", whichwill be used in further examples below): "specversion" : "1.0", "type" : "com.hospital.patient.heartRateMonitor", "source" : "hospitalMonitorSystem", "subject" : "HeartRateReading", "id" : "A234-1234-1234", "time" : "2020-01-05T17:31:00Z", "patientId" : "PID-12345", "department": "UrgentCare", "data" : { "value": "80bpm" and "type" : "com.hospital.patient.bloodPressureMonitor", "subject" : "BloodPressureReading", "id" : "B234-1234-1234", "time" : "2020-02-05T17:31:00Z", "value": "110/70" We can then define a correlation rule, through which all consumed events with the "hospitalMonitorSystem", and the "com.hospital.patient.heartRateMonitor"type that have the same value of the patientId property to be correlated to the created workflow instance: "events": [ "name": "HeartRateReadingEvent", "source": "hospitalMonitorSystem", "type": "com.hospital.patient.heartRateMonitor", "kind": "consumed", "correlation": [ "contextAttributeName": "patientId" If a workflow instance is created (e.g., via Event state) by consuming a "HeartRateReadingEvent" event, all other consumed eventsfrom the defined source and with the defined type that have the same "patientId" as the event that triggered the workflow instanceshould then also be associated with the same instance. You can also correlate multiple events together. In the following example, we assume that the workflow consumes two different event types,and we want to make sure that both are correlated, as in the above example, with the same "patientId": "name": "BloodPressureReadingEvent", "source": "hospitalMonitorSystem", "type": "com.hospital.patient.bloodPressureMonitor", "contextAttributeName": "patientId" Event correlation can be based on equality (values of the defined "contextAttributeName" must be equal), but it can also be basedon comparing it to custom defined values (string, or expression). For example: "contextAttributeName": "department", "contextAttributeValue" : "UrgentCare" In this example, we have two correlation rules defined: The first one is on the "patientId" CloudEvent context attribute, meaning again thatall consumed events from this source and type must have the same "patientId" to be considered. The second rulesays that these events must all have a context attribute named "department" with the value of "UrgentCare". This allows developers to write orchestration workflows that are specifically targeted to patients that are in the hospital urgent care unit,for example. The dataOnly property deals with what Event data is accessible by the consuming Workflow states.If its value is true (default value), only the Event payload is accessible to consuming Workflow states.If false, both Event payload and context attributes should be accessible. AUTH DEFINITION Auth definitions can be used to define authentication information that should be applied to function definitions.It can be used for both the retrieval of the function's resource (as defined by the operation property) and for the function's invocation. name Unique auth definition name string yes scheme Auth scheme, can be "basic", "bearer", or "oauth2". Default is "basic" enum no properties Auth scheme properties. Can be one of "Basic properties definition", "Bearer properties definition", or "OAuth2 properties definition" object yes The name property defines the unique auth definition name.The scheme property defines the auth scheme to be used. Can be "bearer", "basic" or "oauth2".The properties property defines the auth scheme properties information.Can be one of "Basic properties definition", "Bearer properties definition", or "OAuth2 properties definition" See here for more information about Basic Authentication scheme. The Basic properties definition can have two types, either string or object.If string type, it defines a workflow expression that contains all needed Basic auth information.If object type, it has the following properties: username String or a workflow expression. Contains the user name string yes password String or a workflow expression. Contains the user password string yes See here for more information about Bearer Authentication scheme. token String or a workflow expression. Contains the token information string yes See here for more information about OAuth2 Authentication scheme. authority String or a workflow expression. Contains the authority information string no grantType Defines the grant type. Can be "password", "clientCredentials", or "tokenExchange" enum yes clientId String or a workflow expression. Contains the client identifier string yes clientSecret Workflow secret or a workflow expression. Contains the client secret string no scopes Array containing strings or workflow expressions. Contains the OAuth2 scopes array no username String or a workflow expression. Contains the user name. Used only if grantType is 'resourceOwner' string no password String or a workflow expression. Contains the user password. Used only if grantType is 'resourceOwner' string no audiences Array containing strings or workflow expressions. Contains the OAuth2 audiences array no subjectToken String or a workflow expression. Contains the subject token string no requestedSubject String or a workflow expression. Contains the requested subject string no requestedIssuer String or a workflow expression. Contains the requested issuer string no CORRELATION DEFINITION contextAttributeName CloudEvent Extension Context Attribute name string yes contextAttributeValue CloudEvent Extension Context Attribute value string no "contextAttributeName": "department", "contextAttributeValue" : "UrgentCare" - contextAttributeName: patientId - contextAttributeName: department contextAttributeValue: UrgentCare Used to define event correlation rules. Only usable for consumed event definitions. The contextAttributeName property defines the name of the CloudEvent extension context attribute.The contextAttributeValue property defines the value of the defined CloudEvent extension context attribute. ONEVENTS DEFINITION eventRefs References one or more unique event names in the defined workflow events array yes actionMode Specifies how actions are to be performed (in sequence or in parallel). Default is sequential enum no actions Actions to be performed array no eventDataFilter Event data filter definition object no "eventRefs": ["HighBodyTemperature"], "actions": [{ "refName": "sendTylenolOrder", "patientid": "${ .patientId }" eventRefs: - HighBodyTemperature refName: sendTylenolOrder patientid: "${ .patientId }" OnEvent definition allow you to define which actions are to be performedfor the one or more events definitions defined in the eventRefs array.Note that the values of eventRefs array must be unique. The actionMode property defines if the defined actions need to be performed sequentially or in parallel. The actions property defines a list of actions to be performed. When specifying the onEvents definition it is important to consider the Event states exclusive property,because it determines how 'onEvents' is interpreted.Let's look at the following JSON definition of 'onEvents' to show this: "onEvents": [{ "eventRefs": ["HighBodyTemperature", "HighBloodPressure"], "refName": "SendTylenolOrder", "patient": "${ .patientId }" "refName": "CallNurse", Depending on the value of the Event states exclusive property, this definition can mean two different things: If exclusive is set to true, the consumption of either the HighBodyTemperature or HighBloodPressure events will trigger action execution. If exclusive is set to false, the consumption of both the HighBodyTemperature and HighBloodPressure events will trigger action execution. This is visualized in the diagram below: ACTION DEFINITION name Unique Action name string no functionRef References a reusable function definition object or string yes (if eventRef & subFlowRef are not defined) eventRef References a produce and consume reusable event definitions object yes (if functionRef & subFlowRef are not defined) subFlowRef References a workflow to be invoked object or string yes (if eventRef & functionRef are not defined) retryRef References a defined workflow retry definition. If not defined uses the default runtime retry definition string no nonRetryableErrors List of references to defined workflow errors for which the action should not be retried. Used only when autoRetries is set to true array no retryableErrors List of references to defined workflow errors for which the action should be retried. Used only when autoRetries is set to false array no actionDataFilter Action data filter definition object no sleep Defines time periods Workflow Execution should sleep before / after function execution object no condition Expression, if defined, must evaluate to true for this action to be performed. If false, action is disregarded string no "name": "Finalize Application Action", "functionRef": { "refName": "finalizeApplicationFunction", "arguments": { "applicantid": "${ .applicantId }" name: Finalize Application Action functionRef: refName: finalizeApplicationFunction arguments: applicantid: "${ .applicantId }" Actions specify invocations of services or other workflows during Workflow Execution.Service invocation can be done in three different ways: Reference functions definitions by its unique name using the functionRef property. Reference a produced and consumed event definitions via the eventRef property. Reference a sub-workflow invocation via the subFlowRef property. Note that functionRef, eventRef, and subFlowRef are mutually exclusive, meaning that only one of them can bespecified in a single action definition. The name property specifies the action name. In the event-based scenario a service, or a set of services we want to invokeare not exposed via a specific resource URI for example, but can only be invoked via an event.The eventRef property defines thereferenced produced event via its produceEventRef property and a consumed event via its consumeEventRef property. The sleep property can be used to define time periods that Workflow Execution should sleepbefore and/or after function execution. It can have two properties: before - defines the amount of time (ISO 8601 duration format) to sleep before function invocation. after - defines the amount of time (ISO 8601 duration format) to sleep after function invocation. Function invocation timeouts should be handled via the states timeouts definition. The retryRef property references one of the defined workflow retries by it's unique name. If not set, the actionshould be retried according to the default retry policy of the runtime implementation. For more information about workflowretries reference this section. The nonRetryableErrors property is a list that references one or more unique names of workflow error definitions.This is the list of known errors for which the action should not be retried for.It should be used only when the workflow top-level autoRetries property is set to true. The retryableErrors property is a list that references one or more unique names of workflow error definitions.This is the list of known errors for which the action should be retried for.It should be used only when the workflow top-level autoRetries property is set to false. The condition property is a workflow expression. If defined, it must evaluate to truefor this action to be performed. If it evaluates to false the action is skipped.If the condition property is not defined, the action is always performed. SUBFLOW ACTION Often you want to group your workflows into small logical units that solve a particular business problem and can be reused inmultiple other workflow definitions. Reusable workflows are referenced by their id property via the SubFlow action workflowId parameter. For the simple case, subFlowRef can be a string containing the id of the sub-workflow to invoke.If you want to specify other parameters then a subFlowRef should be provided instead. Each referenced workflow receives the SubFlow actions data as workflow data input. Referenced sub-workflows must declare their own function and event definitions. FUNCTIONREF DEFINITION FunctionRef definition can have two types, either string or object.If string type, it defines the name of the referenced function.This can be used as a short-cut definition when you don't need to define any other parameters, for example: "functionRef": "myFunction" Note that if used with string type, the invocation of the function is synchronous. If you need to define parameters in your functionRef definition, you can defineit with its object type which has the following properties: refName Name of the referenced function string yes arguments Arguments (inputs) to be passed to the referenced function object yes (if function type is graphql, otherwise no) selectionSet Used if function type is graphql. String containing a valid GraphQL selection set string yes (if function type is graphql, otherwise no) invoke Specifies if the function should be invoked sync or async. Default is sync enum no "refName": "finalizeApplicationFunction", "arguments": { "applicantid": "${ .applicantId }" refName: finalizeApplicationFunction arguments: applicantid: "${ .applicantId }" The refName property is the name of the referenced function. The arguments property defines the arguments that are to be passed to the referenced function.Here is an example of using the arguments property: "refName": "checkFundsAvailabe", "arguments": { "account": { "id": "${ .accountId }" "forAmount": "${ .payment.amount }", "insufficientMessage": "The requested amount is not available." The invoke property defines how the function is invoked (sync or async). Default value of this property issync, meaning that Workflow Execution should wait until the function completes.If set to async, Workflow Execution should just invoke the function and should not wait until its completion.Note that in this case the action does not produce any results and the associated actions actionDataFilter as well asits retry definition, if defined, should be ignored.In addition, functions that are invoked async do not propagate their errors to the associated action definition and theworkflow state, meaning that any errors that happen during their execution cannot be handled in the workflow statesonErrors definition. Note that errors raised during functions that are invoked async should not fail Workflow Execution. EVENTREF DEFINITION Allows defining invocation of a function via event. produceEventRef Reference to the unique name of a produced event definition string yes consumeEventRef Reference to the unique name of a consumed event definition string no consumeEventTimeout Maximum amount of time (ISO 8601 format) to wait for the consume event. If not defined it be set to the actionExecutionTimeout string no data If string type, an expression which selects parts of the states data output to become the data (payload) of the event referenced by produceEventRef. If object type, a custom object to become the data (payload) of the event referenced by produceEventRef. string or object no contextAttributes Add additional event extension context attributes to the trigger/produced event object no "eventRef": { "produceEventRef": "MakeVetAppointment", "data": "${ .patientInfo }", "consumeEventRef": "VetAppointmentInfo" eventRef: produceEventRef: MakeVetAppointment data: "${ .patientInfo }" consumeEventRef: VetAppointmentInfo References a produced and consumed event definitions via the produceEventRef and consumeEventRef properties, respectively. The data property can have two types: string or object. If it is of string type, it is an expression that can select parts of state datato be used as payload of the event referenced by produceEventRef. If it is of object type, you can define a custom object to be the event payload. The contextAttributes property allows you to add one or more extension context attributesto the trigger/produced event. The consumeEventTimeout property defines the maximum amount of time (ISO 8601 format) to wait for the result event. If not defined it should default to the actionExecutionTimeout.If the event defined by the consumeEventRef property is not received in that set time, action invocation should raise an errorthat can be handled in the states onErrors definition. In case the consumeEventRef is not defined, the consumeEventTimeout property is ignored. The invoke property defines how the function is invoked (sync or async). Default value of this property issync, meaning that Workflow Execution should wait until the function completes (the result event is received).If set to async, Workflow Execution should just produce the trigger event and should not wait for the result event.Note that in this case the action does not produce any results (payload of the result event) and the associated actions eventDataFilter as well asits retry definition, if defined, should be ignored.Functions that are invoked via events (sync or async) do not propagate their errors to the associated action definition and theworkflow state, meaning that any errors that happen during their execution cannot be handled in the workflow statesonErrors definition. Note that errors raised during functions that are invoked sync or async in this caseshould not fail Workflow Execution. SUBFLOWREF DEFINITION SubFlowRef definition can have two types, namely string or object. If string type, it defines the unique id of the sub-workflow to be invoked.This short-hand definition can be used if sub-workflow lookup is done only by its idproperty and not its version property. "subFlowRef": "mySubFlowId" If you need to define the version properties, you can use its object type: workflowId Sub-workflow unique id string yes version Sub-workflow version string no invoke Specifies if the subflow should be invoked sync or async. Default is sync enum no onParentComplete If invoke is async, specifies if subflow execution should terminate or continue when parent workflow completes. Default is terminate enum no "workflowId": "handleApprovedVisaWorkflowID", "version": "2.0.0" workflowId: handleApprovedVisaWorkflowID version: '2.0.0' The workflowId property define the unique ID of the sub-workflow to be invoked.Usually, the workflow id should not be the same id of the workflow where the action is defined. Otherwise, it may occur undesired recurring calls to the same workflow. The version property defined the unique version of the sub-workflow to be invoked.If this property is defined, runtimes should match both the id and the version propertiesdefined in the sub-workflow definition. The invoke property defines how the subflow is invoked (sync or async). Default value of this property issync, meaning that Workflow Execution should wait until the subflow completes.If set to async, Workflow Execution should just invoke the subflow and not wait for its results.Note that in this case the action does not produce any results, and the associated actions actionDataFilter as well asits retry definition, if defined, should be ignored.Subflows that are invoked async do not propagate their errors to the associated action definition and theworkflow state, meaning that any errors that happen during their execution cannot be handled in the workflow statesonErrors definition. Note that errors raised during subflows that are invoked asyncshould not fail Workflow Execution. The onParentComplete property defines how subflow execution that is invoked async should behave if the parent workflowcompletes execution before the subflow completes its own execution.The default value of this property is terminate, meaning that if the parent workflow (the workflow that invoked the subflow)completes, execution of the subflow should be terminated.If it is set to continue, if the parent workflow completes, the subflow execution is allowed to continue its own execution. ERROR DEFINITION errorRef or errorRefs Reference one unique workflow error definition, or multiple unique workflow error definitions string (errorRef) or array (errorRefs) yes transition Transition to next state to handle the error string or object yes (if end is not defined) end End Workflow Execution if this error is encountered boolean or object yes (if transition is not defined) "errorRef": "Item not in inventory", "transition": "IssueRefundToCustomer" errorRef: Item not in inventory transition: IssueRefundToCustomer Error definitions describe checked errors that can occur during Workflow Execution and how to handle them. The errorRef property references the unique workflow error definition. For more info on workflow error handlingreferece this section. The errorRefsproperty references at least one of the defined workflow error definitions.Can be used when errorRef is not used. Usable when you want to define multiple error refs for which the same transitionor end definition should be applied.For more info on workflow error handlingreferece this section. Note that the errorRef and errorRefs properties are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can only specify one or the other,but not both at the same time. The transition property defines the transition to the next workflow state in cases when the definederror happens during runtime execution. If transition is not defined you can also define the end property which will end Workflow Execution at that point.Note that the transition and end properties are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can only specify one or the other,but not both at the same time. For more information, see the Workflow Error Handling sections. RETRY DEFINITION name Unique retry strategy name string yes delay Time delay between retry attempts (ISO 8601 duration format) string no maxAttempts Maximum number of retry attempts. Value of 1 means no retries are performed string or number yes maxDelay Maximum amount of delay between retry attempts (ISO 8601 duration format) string no increment Static duration which will be added to the delay between successive retries (ISO 8601 duration format) string no multiplier Float value by which the delay is multiplied before each attempt. For example: "1.2" meaning that each successive delay is 20% longer than the previous delay. For example, if delay is 'PT10S', then the delay between the first and second attempts will be 10 seconds, and the delay before the third attempt will be 12 seconds. float or string no jitter If float type, maximum amount of random time added or subtracted from the delay between each retry relative to total delay (between 0.0 and 1.0). If string type, absolute maximum amount of random time added or subtracted from the delay between each retry (ISO 8601 duration format) float or string no "name": "TimeoutRetryStrat", "delay": "PT2M", "maxAttempts": 3, "jitter": "PT0.001S" name: TimeoutRetryStrat delay: PT2M maxAttempts: 3 jitter: PT0.001S Defines the states retry policy (strategy). This is an explicit definition and can be reused across multipledefined state actions. The name property specifies the unique name of the retry definition (strategy). This unique namecan be referred by workflow states error definitions. The delay property specifies the initial time delay between retry attempts (ISO 8601 duration format). The increment property specifies a static duration which will be added to the delay between successive retries.To explain this better, let's say we have the following retry definition: "name": "Timeout Errors Strategy", "delay": "PT10S", "increment": "PT2S", "maxAttempts": 4 which means that we will retry up to 4 times after waiting with increasing delay between attempts;in this example 10, 12, 14, and 16 seconds between retries. The multiplier property specifies the value by which the interval time is increased for each of the retry attempts.To explain this better, let's say we have the following retry definition: "multiplier": 2, which means that we will retry up to 4 times after waiting with increasing delay between attempts;in this example 10, 20, 40, and 80 seconds between retries. If both increment and multiplier properties are defined, increment should be applied first and thenthe multiplier when determining the next retry time. The maxAttempts property determines the maximum number of retry attempts allowed and is a positive integer value. The jitter property is important to prevent certain scenarios where clientsare retrying in sync, possibly causing or contributing to a transient failureprecisely because they're retrying at the same time. Adding a typically small,bounded random amount of time to the period between retries serves the purposeof attempting to prevent these retries from happening simultaneously, possiblyreducing total time to complete requests and overall congestion. How this valueis used in the exponential backoff algorithm is left up to implementations. jitter may be specified as a percentage relative to the total delay.Once the next retry attempt delay is calculated, we can apply jitter as a percentage value relative to thiscalculated delay. For example, if your calculated delay for the next retry is six seconds, and we specifya jitter value of 0.3, a random amount of time between 0 and 1.8 (0.3 times 6) is to be added or subtractedfrom the calculated delay. Alternatively, jitter may be defined as an absolute value specified as an ISO8601 duration. This way, the maximum amount of random time added is fixed andwill not increase as new attempts are made. The maxDelay property determines the maximum amount of delay that is desired between retry attempts, and is appliedafter increment, multiplier, and jitter. To explain this better, let's say we have the following retry definition: "maxDelay": "PT100S", "multiplier": 4, "jitter": "PT1S", which means that we will retry up to 4 times after waiting with increasing delay between attempts;in this example we might observe the following series of delays: 11s (min(maxDelay, (delay +/- rand(jitter)) => min(100, 10 + 1)) 43s (min(maxDelay, (11s * multiplier) +/- rand(jitter)) => min(100, (11 * 4) - 1)) 100s (min(maxDelay, (43s * multiplier) +/- rand(jitter)) => min(100, (43 * 4) + 0)) 100s (min(maxDelay, (100s * multiplier) +/- rand(jitter)) => min(100, (100 * 4) - 1)) TRANSITION DEFINITION Transition definition can have two types, either string or object.If string, it defines the name of the state to transition to.This can be used as a short-cut definition when you don't need to define any other parameters, for example: "transition": "myNextState" If you need to define additional parameters in your transition definition, you can defineit with its object type which has the following properties: nextState Name of the state to transition to next string yes compensate If set to true, triggers workflow compensation before this transition is taken. Default is false boolean no produceEvents Array of producedEvent definitions. Events to be produced before the transition takes place array no "produceEvents": [{ "eventRef": "produceResultEvent", "data": "${ .result.data }" }], "nextState": "EvalResultState" produceEvents: - eventRef: produceResultEvent data: "${ .result.data }" nextState: EvalResultState The nextState property defines the name of the state to transition to next.The compensate property allows you to trigger compensation before the transition (if set to true).The produceEvents property allows you to define a list of events to produce before the transition happens. Transitions allow you to move from one state (control-logic block) to another. For more information see theTransitions section section. SWITCH STATE DATA CONDITIONS name Data condition name string no condition Workflow expression evaluated against state data. Must evaluate to true or false string yes transition Transition to another state if condition is true string or object yes (if end is not defined) end End Workflow Execution if condition is true boolean or object yes (if transition is not defined) "name": "Eighteen or older", "condition": "${ .applicant | .age >= 18 }", "transition": "StartApplication" name: Eighteen or older condition: "${ .applicant | .age >= 18 }" transition: StartApplication Switch state data conditions specify a data-based condition statement, which causes a transition to anotherworkflow state if evaluated to true.The condition property of the condition defines an expression (e.g., ${ .applicant | .age > 18 }), which selectsparts of the state data input. The condition must evaluate to true or false. If the condition is evaluated to true, you can specify either the transition or end definitionsto decide what to do, transition to another workflow state, or end Workflow Execution. Note that transition and enddefinitions are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can specify either one or the other, but not both. SWITCH STATE EVENT CONDITIONS name Event condition name string no eventRef References an unique event name in the defined workflow events string yes "name": "Visa approved", "eventRef": "visaApprovedEvent", "transition": "HandleApprovedVisa" name: Visa approved eventRef: visaApprovedEvent transition: HandleApprovedVisa Switch state event conditions specify events, which the switch state must wait for. Each conditioncan reference one workflow-defined event. Upon arrival of this event, the associated transition is taken.The eventRef property references a name of one of the defined workflow events. If the referenced event is received, you can specify either the transition or end definitionsto decide what to do, transition to another workflow state, or end Workflow Execution. The eventDataFilter property can be used to filter event data when it is received. Note that transition and enddefinitions are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can specify either one or the other, but not both. PARALLEL STATE BRANCH name Branch name string yes actions Actions to be executed in this branch array yes timeouts Branch specific timeout settings object no "name": "Branch1", "functionRef": { "refName": "functionNameOne", "arguments": { "order": "${ .someParam }" "refName": "functionNameTwo", "order": "${ .someParamTwo }" name: Branch1 refName: functionNameOne order: "${ .someParam }" refName: functionNameTwo order: "${ .someParamTwo }" Each branch receives the same copy of the Parallel state's data input. A branch can define actions that need to be executed. For the SubFlowRef action, the workflow id should not be the same id of the workflow where the branch is defined. Otherwise, it may occur undesired recurring calls to the same workflow. The timeouts property can be used to set branch specific timeout settings. Parallel state branches can set theactionExecTimeout and branchExecTimeout timeout properties. For more information on workflow timeouts reference theWorkflow Timeouts section. PARALLEL STATE HANDLING EXCEPTIONS Exceptions can occur during execution of Parallel state branches. By default, exceptions that are not handled within branches stop branch execution and are propagatedto the Parallel state and should be handled with its onErrors definition. If the parallel states branch defines actions, all exceptions that arise from executing these actions (after allallotted retries are exhausted)are propagated to the parallel stateand can be handled with the parallel states onErrors definition. If the parallel states defines a subflow action, exceptions that occur during execution of the called workflowcan choose to handle exceptions on their own. All unhandled exceptions from the called workflowexecution however are propagated back to the parallel state and can be handled with the parallel statesonErrors definition. Note that once an error that is propagated to the parallel state from a branch and handled by thestates onErrors definition is handled (its associated transition is taken) no further errors from branches of thisparallel state should be considered as the workflow control flow logic has already moved to a different state. START DEFINITION Can be either string or object type. If type string, it defines the name of the workflow starting state. "start": "MyStartingState" In this case it's assumed that the schedule property is not defined. If the start definition is of type object, it has the following structure: stateName Name of the starting workflow state string no schedule Define the recurring time intervals or cron expressions at which workflow instances should be automatically started. string or object yes "stateName": "MyStartingstate", "schedule": "2020-03-20T09:00:00Z/PT2H" stateName: MyStartingstate schedule: 2020-03-20T09:00:00Z/PT2H Start definition explicitly defines how/when workflow instances should be created and what the workflow starting state is. The start definition can be either string or object type. If string type, it defines the name of the workflow starting state. If object type, it provides the ability to set the workflow starting state name, as well as the schedule property. The stateName property can be set to define the starting workflow state. If not specified, the first statein the workflow states definition should be used as the starting workflow state. The schedule property allows to define scheduled workflow instance creation.Scheduled starts have two different choices. You can define a recurring time interval or cron-based schedule at which a workflowinstance should be created (automatically). You can also define cron-based scheduled starts, which allows you to specify periodically started workflow instances based on a cron definition.Cron-based scheduled starts can handle absolute time intervals (i.e., not calculated in respect to some particular point in time).One use case for cron-based scheduled starts is a workflow that performs periodical data batch processing.In this case we could use a cron definition 0 0/5 * * * ? to define that a workflow instance from the workflow definition should be created every 5 minutes, starting at full hour. Here are some more examples of cron expressions and their meanings: * * * * * - Create workflow instance at the top of every minute 0 * * * * - Create workflow instance at the top of every hour 0 */2 * * * - Create workflow instance every 2 hours 0 9 8 * * - Create workflow instance at 9:00:00AM on the eighth day of every month See here to get more information on defining cron expressions. One thing to discuss when dealing with cron-based scheduled starts is when the workflow starting state is an Event.Event states define that workflow instances are triggered by the existence of the defined event(s).Defining a cron-based scheduled starts for the runtime implementations would mean that there needs to be an event service that issuesthe needed events at the defined times to trigger workflow instance creation. Defining a start definition is not required. If it's not defined, the starting workflowstate has to be the very first state defined in the workflow states array. SCHEDULE DEFINITION Schedule definition can have two types, either string or object.If string type, it defines time interval describing when the workflow instance should be automatically created.This can be used as a short-cut definition when you don't need to define any other parameters, for example: "schedule": "R/PT2H" If you need to define the cron or the timezone parameters in your schedule definition, you can defineit with its object type which has the following properties: interval A recurring time interval expressed in the derivative of ISO 8601 format specified below. Declares that workflow instances should be automatically created at the start of each time interval in the series. string yes (if cron is not defined) cron Cron expression defining when workflow instances should be automatically created object yes (if interval is not defined) timezone Timezone name used to evaluate the interval & cron-expression. If the interval specifies a date-time w/ timezone then proper timezone conversion will be applied. (default: UTC). string no "cron": "0 0/15 * * * ?" cron: 0 0/15 * * * ? The interval property uses a derivative of ISO 8601 recurring time interval format to describe a series of consecutive time intervals for workflow instances to be automatically created at the start of. Unlike full ISO 8601, this derivative format does not allow expression of an explicit number of recurrences or identification of a series by the date and time at the start and end of its first time interval.There are three ways to express a recurring interval: R/<Start>/<Duration>: Defines the start time and a duration, for example: "R/2020-03-20T13:00:00Z/PT2H", meaning workflowinstances will be automatically created every 2 hours starting from March 20th 2020 at 1pm UTC. R/<Duration>/<End>: Defines a duration and an end, for example: "R/PT2H/2020-05-11T15:30:00Z", meaning that workflow instances will beautomatically created every 2 hours until until May 11th 2020 at 3:30pm UTC (i.e., the last instance will be created 2 hours prior to that, at 1:30pm UTC). R/<Duration>: Defines a duration only, for example: "R/PT2H", meaning workflow instances will be automatically created every 2 hours. The start time of the first interval may be indeterminate, but should be delayed by no more than the specified duration and must repeat on schedule after that (this is effectively supplying the start time "out-of-band" as permitted ISO ISO 8601-1:2019 section 5.6.1 NOTE 1). Each runtime implementation should document how the start time for a duration-only interval is established. The cron property uses a cron expressionto describe a repeating interval upon which a workflow instance should be created automatically.For more information see the cron definition section. The timezone property is used to define a time zone name to evaluate the cron or interval expression against. If not specified, it should defaultto UTC time zone. See here for a list of timezone names. For ISO 8601 date timevalues in interval or cron.validUntil, runtimes should treat timezone as the 'local time' (UTC if timezone is not defined by the user). Note that when the workflow starting state is an Eventdefining cron-based scheduled starts for the runtime implementations would mean that there needs to be an event service that issuesthe needed events at the defined times to trigger workflow instance creation. CRON DEFINITION Cron definition can have two types, either string or object.If string type, it defines the cron expression describing when the workflow instance should be created (automatically).This can be used as a short-cut definition when you don't need to define any other parameters, for example: "cron": "0 15,30,45 * ? * *" If you need to define the validUntil parameters in your cron definition, you can defineit with its object type which has the following properties: expression Cron expression describing when the workflow instance should be created (automatically) string yes validUntil Specific date and time (ISO 8601 format) when the cron expression is no longer valid string no "expression": "0 15,30,45 * ? * *", "validUntil": "2021-11-05T08:15:30-05:00" expression: 0 15,30,45 * ? * * validUntil: '2021-11-05T08:15:30-05:00' The expression property is a a cron expression which defineswhen workflow instances should be created (automatically). The validUntil property defines a date and time (using ISO 8601 format). When thevalidUntil time is reached, the cron expression for instances creations of this workflowshould no longer be valid. For example let's say we have to following cron definitions: This tells the runtime engine to create an instance of this workflow every hourat minutes 15, 30 and 45. This is to be done until November 5, 2021, 8:15:30 am, US Eastern Standard Timeas defined by the validUntil property value. END DEFINITION Can be either boolean or object type. If type boolean, must be set to true, for example: "end": true In this case it's assumed that the terminate property has its default value of false, and the produceEvents,compensate, and continueAs properties are not defined. If the end definition is of type object, it has the following structure: terminate If true. terminates workflow instance execution boolean no produceEvents Array of producedEvent definitions. Defines events that should be produced. array no compensate If set to true, triggers workflow compensation before Workflow Execution completes. Default is false boolean no continueAs Defines that current Workflow Execution should stop, and execution should continue as a new workflow instance of the provided id string or object no "terminate": true, "produceEvents": [{ "eventRef": "provisioningCompleteEvent", "data": "${ .provisionedOrders }" terminate: true - eventRef: provisioningCompleteEvent data: "${ .provisionedOrders }" End definitions are used to explicitly define execution completion of a workflow instance or Workflow Execution path.A workflow definition must include at least one workflow state.Note that Switch states cannot declare to be workflow end states. Their conditions however candefine a stop of Workflow Execution. The terminate property, if set to true, completes the workflow instance execution, this any other activeexecution paths.If a terminate end is reached inside a ForEach or Parallel state the entire workflow instance is terminated. The produceEvents allows defining events which should be producedby the workflow instance before workflow stops its execution. It's important to mention that if the workflow keepActive property is set totrue,the only way to complete execution of the workflow instanceis if Workflow Execution reaches a state that defines an end definition with terminate property set to true,or, if the workflowExecTimeout property is defined, the time defined in its intervalis reached. The compensate property defines that workflow compensation should be performed before the workflowexecution is completed. The continueAs property defines that the current workflow instance should stop its execution,and worklow execution should continue as a new instance of a new workflow.When defined, it should be assumed that terminate is true. If continueAs is defined, and terminate is explicitlyset to false, runtimes should report this to users. Producing events, and compensation should still be performed (if defined)before the Workflow Execution is stopped, and continued as a new workflow instance with the defined workflow id. PRODUCEDEVENT DEFINITION eventRef Reference to a defined unique event name in the events definition string yes data If string type, an expression which selects parts of the states data output to become the data (payload) of the produced event. If object type, a custom object to become the data (payload) of produced event. string or object no contextAttributes Add additional event extension context attributes object no "eventRef": "provisioningCompleteEvent", "data": "${ .provisionedOrders }", "contextAttributes": [{ "buyerId": "${ .buyerId }" }] eventRef: provisioningCompleteEvent data: "${ .provisionedOrders }" contextAttributes: - buyerId: "${ .buyerId }" Defines the event (CloudEvent format) to be produced when Workflow Execution completes or during a workflow transitions.The eventRef property must match the name ofone of the defined produced events in the events definition. The data property can have two types, object or string. If of string type, it is an expression that can select parts of state datato be used as the event payload. If of object type, you can define a custom object to be the event payload. The contextAttributes property allows you to add one or more extension context attributesto the generated event. Being able to produce events when Workflow Execution completes or during state transitionallows for event-based orchestration communication.For example, completion of an orchestration workflow can notify other orchestration workflows to decide if they need to act uponthe produced event, or notify monitoring services of the current state of Workflow Execution, etc.It can be used to create very dynamic orchestration scenarios. TRANSITIONS Serverless workflow states can have one or more incoming and outgoing transitions (from/to other states).Each state can define a transition definition that is used to determine whichstate to transition to next. Implementers must use the unique State name property for determining the transition. Events can be produced during state transitions. The produceEvents property of the transition definitions allows youto reference one or more defined produced events in the workflow events definitions.For each of the produced events you can select what parts of state data to be the event payload. Transitions can trigger compensation via their compensate property. See the Workflow Compensationsection for more information. ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES Specifying additional properties, namely properties which are not defined by the specificationare only allowed in the Workflow Definition.Additional properties serve the same purpose as Workflow Metadata.They allow you to enrich the workflow definition with custom information. Additional properties, just like workflow metadata, should not affect Workflow Execution.Implementations may choose to use additional properties or ignore them. It is recommended to use workflow metadata instead of additional properties in the workflow definition. Let's take a look at an example of additional properties: "id": "myworkflow", "name": "My Test Workflow", "start": "My First State", "loglevel": "Info", "environment": "Production", "category": "Sales", "states": [ ... ] In this example, we specify the loglevel, environment, and category additional properties. Note the same can be also specified using workflow metadata, which is the preferred approach: "name": "Py Test Workflow", "metadata": { "loglevel": "Info", "environment": "Production", "category": "Sales" Serverless Workflow language allows you to define explicit error handling, meaning you can define what should happenin case of errors inside your workflow model rather than some generic error handling entity.This allows error handling to become part of your orchestration activities and as such part of your business problemsolutions. The idea behind the way Serverless Workflow defines error handling is that workflows should only fail due to unknown bugsduring execution. In general, you should always write your workflows so that they do not fail on any known failures. Each workflow state can define error handling, which is related only to errors that may arise during itsexecution. Error handling defined in one state cannot be used to handle errors that happened during execution of another stateduring Workflow Execution. Unknown errors that may arise during workflow state execution that are not explicitly handled within the workflow definitionshould be reported by runtime implementations and halt Workflow Execution. Within workflow definitions, errors defined are domain specific, meaning they are defined withinthe actual business domain, rather than their technical (programming-language-specific) description. For example, we can define errors such as "Order not found", or "Item not in inventory", rather than having touse terms such as "java.lang.IllegalAccessError", or "response.status == 404", whichmight make little to no sense to our specific problem domain, as well as may not be portable across various runtime implementations. In addition to the domain specific error name, users have the option to also add an optional error codeto help runtime implementations with mapping defined errors to concrete underlying technical ones. Runtime implementations must be able to map the error domain specific name (and the optional error code)to concrete technical errors that arise during Workflow Execution. Known workflow errors, that we know we need to handle during Workflow Execution should be defined inthe workflow top-level 'errors' property. This property can be either a string type, meaning it can referencea reusable JSON or Yaml definition file including the error definitions, or it can have an array type where you candefine these checked errors in-line in your workflow definition. Here is an example of such a definition for both cases: Referencing a reusable JSON/Yaml error definition file: "errors": "file://documents/reusable/errors.json" errors: file://documents/reusable/errors.json Defining workflow errors in-line: "errors": [ "name": "Service not found error", "code": "404", "description": "Server has not found anything matching the provided service endpoint information" errors: - name: Service not found error code: '404' description: Server has not found anything matching the provided service endpoint information These defined errors can then be referenced by their unique name in both states onErrors definitions as well as inactions nonRetryableErrors and retryableErrors properties. Retries allow workflows to deal with intermittent failures of services they are trying to invoke.In addition, retries allow workflows to continue (not fail) execution and allow us to fix possible errors with invokedservices and continue execution after they are fixed.Retries are important for both short-lived and long-lived workflows, as well as in both stateless and statefulscenarios. Serverless workflow supports two distinct ways of defining retries: Retrying on specified known (checked) errors. Automatic retrying on both known (checked) and not-known (unchecked) errors. Which retry option the workflow should use by default is defined via the workflow top-level autoRetries property.By default, the value of the autoRetries is set to false, meaning that retry option 1) is used by default.You can enable automatic retrying (option 2) by setting autoRetries to true. Regardless of the chosen retries option, note that workflows in general should be designed to not fail.Workflows should be able to recover from intermittent failures. The next sections provide more details to each action retry option. This is the default option when the workflow top-level autoRetries property is not specified or is set to false.This retry options is suited for stateless / short-running workflows where retries should be performed when specificallywanted. Note that in this scenario when unknown (unchecked) errors happen during action execution (service invocation),Workflow Execution should fail. Let's take a look at an example. To start, let's define a workflow top-level retries definition: "retries": [ "name": "FirstRetryStrategy", "delay": "PT1M", "maxAttempts": 5 "name": "SecondRetryStrategy", "delay": "PT10M", "maxAttempts": 10 retries: - name: FirstRetryStrategy delay: PT1M maxAttempts: 5 - name: SecondRetryStrategy delay: PT10M maxAttempts: 10 Our retries definitions can be referenced by actions. For example: "actions": [ "functionRef": "MyFirstFunction", "retryRef": "FirstRetryStrategy", "retryableErrors": ["SomeErrorOne", "SomeErrorTwo"] "functionRef": "MySecondFunction", "retryRef": "SecondRetryStrategy", "retryableErrors": ["SomeErrorTwo", "SomeErrorThree"] "functionRef": "MyThirdFunction" - functionRef: MyFirstFunction retryRef: FirstRetryStrategy nonRetryableErrors: - SomeErrorOne - SomeErrorTwo - functionRef: MySecondFunction retryRef: SecondRetryStrategy - SomeErrorThree - functionRef: MyThirdFunction Each action can define the retry strategy it wants to use. If it does not define one, the action is in this case not retries.Actions can define a list of known errors in its retryableErrors array. If defined, then the action should be retriedfor those errors according to the referenced retry strategy. In our example, "MyFirstFunction" invocation should be retried according to the "FirstRetryStrategy" policy only on known errors"SomeErrorOne" and "SomeErrorTwo". If for a known error (defined in retryableErrors) the retry limit is reached and the error still persist, it can be handled in the statesonErrors definition. If an unknown (unchecked) error happens during action execution, and this error is also not handled in the states onErrors definition, theWorkflow Execution should fail. This is the option used when the workflow top-level autoRetries property is set to true.Automatic retries are well suited to long-running and stateful workflow orchestrations. It allows workflowsto recover from failures thus providing more resilience. There is a possible cost associated with automatic retriesin terms of resource and computing power utilization. With this retries option, action executions should be retried automatically for both known (checked) as well as unknown (unchecked)errors. This means that you do not have to define a retry strategy for actions for them to have retried, it's included by default.Users can still define a custom retry strategy for each action via the retryRef property. If a retry strategy is not defined, a default retry strategy should be used.Runtime implementations can define their own default retry strategy. Serverless Workflow recommends the following settings: maxAttempts to be unlimited, meaning that the action should be retried indefinitely until successful. delay to be set to one second, meaning that there is a one second delay between action retries. multiplier to be set to two meaning that the delay should be multiplied by two for each retry attempt. Runtimes should document their default retry strategy to users, so it's clear whichproperty values they are using for the default. Actions can define for which known (checked) errors they should not be retried for.This is done via the actions nonRetryableErrors property. If a known error happens during action executionwhich is included in the nonRetryableErrors property array, that action should not be retried and the errorthen should be handled in the workflow states onErrors property. Let's take a look at an examples of defining retries when using the automatic retries option.This example assumes that the workfow top level autoRetries property is set to true.To start, let's define a workflow top-level retries definition: "name": "DoNotRetryStrategy", "maxAttempts": 1 - name: DoNotRetryStrategy maxAttempts: 1 Our retry definitions can be referenced by state actions. For example: "nonRetryableErrors": ["SomeErrorOne", "SomeErrorTwo"] "nonRetryableErrors": ["SomeErrorTwo", "SomeErrorThree"] "functionRef": "MyFourthFunction", "retryRef": "DoNotRetryStrategy" - functionRef: MyFourthFunction retryRef: DoNotRetryStrategy In our example the first action named MyFirstFunction is going to be retried according to the FirstRetryStrategyretry policyfor all errors except SomeErrorOne and SomeErrorTwo. The seconds action named MySecondFunction is going to be retried according to the SecondRetryStrategyretry policyfor all errors except SomeErrorTwo and SomeErrorThree. The third action named MyThirdFunction is going to retried according to the default runtime retry policy.It will be retried for all errors both known (checked) as well as unknown (unckecked). The fourth action named MyFourthFunction is going to be retried according to the DoNotRetryStrategyretry policy which has the maxAttempts property set to 1, meaning that this action will not be retried. Workflow timeouts define the maximum times for: Workflow execution State execution Action execution Branch execution Event consumption time The specification allows for timeouts to be defined on the top-level workflow definition, as well asin each of the workflow state definitions. Note that the timeout settings defined in states, and state branches overwrite the top-levelworkflow definition for state, action and branch execution. If they are not defined, then the top-leveltimeout settings should take in effect. To give an example, let's say that in our workflow definition we define the timeout for state execution: "id": "testWorkflow", ... "timeouts": { "stateExecTimeout": "PT2S" This top-level workflow timeout setting defines that the maximum execution time of all defined workflow statesis two seconds each. Now let's say that we have worfklow states "A" and "B". State "A" does not define a timeout definition, but state"B" does: "name": "B", "type": "operation", "stateExecTimeout": "PT10S" Since state "A" does not overwrite the top-level stateExecTimeout, its execution timeout should be inherited fromthe top-level timeout definition.On the other hand, state "B" does define it's own stateExecTimeout, in which case it would overwrite the defaultsetting, meaning that it would its execution time has a max limit of ten seconds. Defining timeouts is not mandatory, meaning that if not defined, all the timeout settings should be assumed tobe "unlimited". Note that the defined Workflow Execution timeout has precedence over all other defined timeouts.Just to give an extreme example, let's say we define the Workflow Execution timeout to ten seconds,and the state execution timeout to twenty seconds. In this case if the Workflow Execution timeout is reachedit should follow the rules of Workflow Execution timeout and end Workflow Execution, no matter what thestate execution time has been set to. Let's take a look all possible timeout definitions: Workflow timeouts are defined with the top-level timeouts property. It can have two types, string and object.If string type it defines an URI that points to a Json or Yaml file containing the workflow timeout definitions.If object type, it is used to define the timeout definitions in-line and has the following properties: workflowExecTimeout Workflow execution timeout (ISO 8601 duration format) string or object no stateExecTimeout Workflow state execution timeout (ISO 8601 duration format) string no actionExecTimeout Actions execution timeout (ISO 8601 duration format) string no branchExecTimeout Branch execution timeout (ISO 8601 duration format) string no eventTimeout Default timeout for consuming defined events (ISO 8601 duration format) string no The eventTimeout property defines the maximum amount of time to wait to consume defined events. If not specified it should default to"unlimited". The branchExecTimeout property defines the maximum execution time for a single branch. If not specified it should default to"unlimited". The actionExecTimeout property defines the maximum execution time for a single actions definition. If not specified it should default to"unlimited". Note that an action definition can include multiple actions. The stateExecTimeout property defines the maximum execution time for a single workflow state. If not specified it should default to"unlimited". The workflowExecTimeout property defines the Workflow Execution timeout.It is defined using the ISO 8601 duration format. If not defined, the Workflow Execution should be given "unlimited"amount of time to complete.workflowExecTimeout can have two possibly types, either string or object.If string type, it defines the maximum Workflow Execution time.If Object type it has the following format: WORKFLOWEXECTIMEOUT DEFINITION duration Timeout duration (ISO 8601 duration format) string yes interrupt If false, workflow instance is allowed to finish current execution. If true, current Workflow Execution is stopped immediately. Default is false boolean no runBefore Name of a workflow state to be executed before workflow instance is terminated string no "duration": "PT2M", "runBefore": "createandsendreport" duration: PT2M runBefore: createandsendreport The duration property defines the time duration of the execution timeout. Once a workflow instance is created,and the amount of the defined time is reached, the workflow instance should be terminated. The interrupt property defines if the currently running instance should be allowed to finish its currentexecution flow before it needs to be terminated. If set to true, the current instance execution should stop immediately. The runBefore property defines a name of a workflow state to be executed before workflow instance is terminated.States referenced by runBefore (as well as any other states that they transition to) must obey following rules: They should not have any incoming transitions (should not be part of the main workflow control-flow logic) They cannot be states marked for compensation (have their usedForCompensation property set to true) If it is a single state, it must define an end definition, if it transitions to other states,at last one must define it. They can transition only to states are also not part of the main control flow logic (and are not markedfor compensation). Runtime implementations should raise compile time / parsing exceptions if any of the rules mentioned above arenot obeyed in the workflow definition. All workflow states except Sleep and Inject States can define the timeouts property and can define different timeoutsettings depending on their state type.Please reference each workflow state definitions for more information on whichtimeout settings are available for each state type. Workflow states timeouts cannot define the workflowExecTimeout property. Workflow states can set their stateExecTimeout property inside the timeouts definition.The value of this property is a time duration (ISO 8601 duration format).It must be a duration that's greater than zero and defines the total state execution timeout.When this timeout is reached, state executionshould be stopped and can be handled as a timeout error in the states onErrors definition. Parallel states can define the branchExecTimeout property. If defined on the statelevel, it applies to each branch of the Parallel state. Note that each parallel state branchcan overwrite this setting to define its own branch execution timeout.If a branch does not define this timeout property, it should be inherited from it's state definition branch timeout setting.If its state does not define it either, it should be inherited from the top-level workflow branch timeout settings. The Event state timeouts property can be used tospecify state specific timeout settings. For event state it can contain the eventTimeout propertywhich is defined using the ISO 8601 data and time format.You can specify for example "PT15M" to represent 15 minutes or "P2DT3H4M" to represent 2 days, 3 hours and 4 minutes.eventTimeout values should always be represented as durations and not as specific time intervals. The eventTimeout property needs to be described in detail for Event states as it depends on whether or not the Event state is a workflow starting state or not. If the Event state is a workflow starting state, incoming events may trigger workflow instances. In this case,if the exclusive property is set to true, the eventTimeout property should be ignored. If the exclusive property is set to false, in this case, the defined eventTimeout represents the timebetween arrival of specified events. To give an example, consider the following: "name": "ExampleEventState", "type": "event", "exclusive": false, "timeouts": { "eventTimeout": "PT2M" "onEvents": [ "eventRefs": [ "ExampleEvent1", "ExampleEvent2" ... ] "end": { "terminate": true The first eventTimeout would start once any of the referenced events are consumed. If the second event does not occur withinthe defined eventTimeout, no workflow instance should be created. If the event state is not a workflow starting state, the eventTimeout property is relative to the time when thestate becomes active. If the defined event conditions (regardless of the value of the exclusive property)are not satisfied within the defined timeout period, the event state should transition to the next state or end the workflowinstance in case it is an end state without performing any actions. Compensation deals with undoing or reversing the work of one or more states which havealready successfully completed. For example, let's say that we have charged a customer $100 for an itempurchase. In the case customer laster on decides to cancel this purchase we need to undo it. One way ofdoing that is to credit the customer $100. It's important to understand that compensation with workflows is not the same as for example rolling backa transaction (a strict undo). Compensating a workflow state which has successfully completedmight involve multiple logical steps and thus is part of the overall business logic that must bedefined within the workflow itself. To explain this let's use our previous example and say that when ourcustomer made the item purchase, our workflow has sent her/him a confirmation email. In the case, tocompensate this purchase, we cannot just "undo" the confirmation email sent. Instead, we want tosend a second email to the customer which includes purchase cancellation information. Compensation in Serverless Workflow must be explicitly defined by the workflow control flow logic.It cannot be dynamically triggered by initial workflow data, event payloads, results of service invocations, orerrors. Each workflow state can define how it should be compensated via its compensatedBy property.This property references another workflow state (by its unique name) which is responsible for the actual compensation. States referenced by compensatedBy (as well as any other states that they transition to) must obey following rules: They cannot be an event state They cannot define an end definition. If they do, it should be ignored They must define the usedForCompensation property and set it to true They can transition only to states which also have their usedForCompensation property set to true They cannot themselves set their compensatedBy property to any state (compensation is not recursive) Let's take a look at an example workflow state which defines its compensatedBy property, and the compensationstate it references: "states": [ "name": "NewItemPurchase", "type": "event", "onEvents": [ "eventRefs": [ "NewPurchase" ], "actions": [ "refName": "DebitCustomerFunction", "customerid": "${ .purchase.customerid }", "amount": "${ .purchase.amount }" "refName": "SendPurchaseConfirmationEmailFunction", "customerid": "${ .purchase.customerid }" ] ], "compensatedBy": "CancelPurchase", "transition": "SomeNextWorkflowState" "name": "CancelPurchase", "type": "operation", "usedForCompensation": true, "actions": [ "refName": "CreditCustomerFunction", "customerid": "${ .purchase.customerid }", "amount": "${ .purchase.amount }" "refName": "SendPurchaseCancellationEmailFunction", "customerid": "${ .purchase.customerid }" - name: NewItemPurchase type: event onEvents: - eventRefs: - NewPurchase actions: - functionRef: refName: DebitCustomerFunction arguments: customerid: "${ .purchase.customerid }" amount: "${ .purchase.amount }" refName: SendPurchaseConfirmationEmailFunction compensatedBy: CancelPurchase transition: SomeNextWorkflowState - name: CancelPurchase type: operation usedForCompensation: true refName: CreditCustomerFunction customerid: "${ .purchase.customerid }" amount: "${ .purchase.amount }" refName: SendPurchaseCancellationEmailFunction In this example our "NewItemPurchase" event state waits for a "NewPurchase" event and thendebits the customer and sends them a purchase confirmation email. It defines that it's compensated by the"CancelPurchase" operation state which performs two actions, namely credits back thepurchase amount to customer and sends them a purchase cancellation email. As previously mentioned, compensation must be explicitly triggered by the workflows control-flow logic.This can be done via transition and end definitions. Let's take a look at each: Compensation triggered on transition: "transition": { "compensate": true, "nextState": "NextWorkflowState" transition: compensate: true nextState: NextWorkflowState Transitions can trigger compensations by specifying the compensate property and setting it to true.This means that before the transition is executed (workflow continues its execution to the "NextWorkflowState" in this example),workflow compensation must be performed. Compensation triggered by end definition: "end": { "compensate": true End definitions can trigger compensations by specifying the compensate property and setting it to true.This means that before workflow finishes its execution workflow compensation must be performed. Note thatin case when the end definition has its produceEvents property set, compensation must be performed beforeproducing the specified events and ending Workflow Execution.In the case the end definition has a continueAs property defined, compensation must be performed beforeWorkflow Execution continues as a new workflow invocation.In the case where the end definition has both produceEvents, and continueAs compensation is performed first,then the event should be produced, and then the workflow should continue its execution as a new workflow invocation. Now that we have seen how to define and trigger compensation, we need to go into details on how compensation should be executed.Compensation is performed on all already successfully completed states (that define compensatedBy) in reverse order.Compensation is always done in sequential order, and should not be executed in parallel. Let's take a look at the following workflow image: In this example lets say our Workflow Execution is at the "End" state which defines the compensate property to trueas shown in the previous section. States with a red border, namely "A", "B", "D" and "E" are states which have so farbeen executed successfully. State "C" has not been executed during Workflow Execution in our example. When Workflow Execution encounters our "End" state, compensation has to be performed. This is done in reverse order: State "E" is not compensated as it does not define a compensatedBy state State "D" is compensated by executing compensation "D1" State "B" is compensated by executing "B1" and then "B1-2" State C is not compensated as it was never active during Workflow Execution State A is not comped as it does not define a compensatedBy state So if we look just at the Workflow Execution flow, the same workflow could be seen as: In our example, when compensation triggers,the current workflow data is passed as input to the "D1" state, the first compensation state for our example.The states data output is then passed as states data input to "B1", and so on. In some cases when compensation is triggered, some states such as Parallel and ForEachstates can still be "active", meaning they still might have some async executions that are being performed. If compensation needs to performed on such still active states, the state execution must be first cancelled.After it is cancelled, compensation should be performed. States that are marked as usedForCompensation can define error handling via theironErrors property just like any other workflow states. In case of unrecoverable errors during their execution(errors not explicitly handled),Workflow Execution should be stopped, which is the same behavior as when not using compensation as well. In some cases our workflows are deployed and executed on runtimes and/or cloud platforms that expose someexecution limitations such as finite execution duration, finite number of workflow transitions, etc.Some runtimes, especially when dealing with stateful workflow orchestrations have a finite limit ofexecution history log sizes, meaning that once a long-running workflow reaches these limits Workflow Executions islikely to be forced to stop before reaching its completion. This can result in unexpected issues, especially withmission-critical workflows. For those cases, the Serverless Workflow DSL provides a way to explicitly define stopping the current workflowinstance execution, and starting a new one (for the same workflow id or a different one).This can be done via the end definitions continueAs property. The end definitions continueAs can be either of type string or object.If string type, it contains the unique workflow id of the workflow that the execution should continue as, for example: { "continueAs": "myworkflowid" Defining this should stop the current Workflow Execution, and continue execution as a new workflow instance of theworkflow which defines the workflow id of "myworkflowid". The state data where this is define shouldbecome the workflow data input of the workflow that is continuing the current Workflow Execution. Note that any defined produceEvents and compensate definitions should be honored before continueAs is applied. If object type, the continueAs property has the following properties: workflowId Unique id of the workflow to continue execution as. string yes version Version of the workflow to continue execution as. string no data If string type, a workflow expression which selects parts of the states data output to become the workflow data input of continued execution. If object type, a custom object to become the workflow data input of the continued execution. string or object no workflowExecTimeout Workflow execution timeout to be used by the workflow continuing execution. Overwrites any specific settings set by that workflow. string or object no Continuing execution with continueAs can also be used inside sub-Workflow Executions, which brings its next use case. Workflows can invoke sub-workflows during their execution. In Serverless Workflow DSL, sub-workflows are invokedsimilarly to other function types via the SubFlowRef Definitionin workflow states Action definitions. Just like "parent" workflows, sub-workflow can also be long-running, and can run into the same type of runtime/serverless platformlimitations as previously discussed. As such they can also use continueAs to stop their current execution and continue it asa new one of the same or different workflow id. Note that when a sub-workflow is invoked it can produce a result that is then merged into the parent workflow state data.This may bring up a question as to what happens when a sub-workflow calls continueAs in terms of what is returned asresult to of its invocation by the parent workflow. No matter how many times sub-workflow may use continueAs, to the parent workflow it should be as a single invocation is performed,meaning that the results of the last sub-workflow invocation (triggered by continueAs) should be used as thedata returned by the invocation of the sub-workflow to the parent workflow. In any application, regardless of size or type, one thing is for sure: changes happen.Versioning your workflow definitions is an important task to consider. Versions indicatechanges or updates of your workflow definitions to the associated execution runtimes. There are two places in the workflow definition where versioning can be applied: Top level workflow definition version property. Actions subflowRef version property. The version property must respect the semantic versioning guidelines. Workflow constants are used to define static, and immutable, data which is available to Workflow Expressions. Constants can be defined via the Workflow top-level "constants" property,for example: "constants": { "Translations": { "Dog": { "Serbian": "pas", "Spanish": "perro", "French": "chien" Constants can only be accessed inside Workflow expressions via the $CONST variable.Runtimes must make $CONST available to expressions as a predefined variable. Here is an example of using constants in Workflow expressions: ..., "condition": "${ .applicant | .age >= $CONST.AGE.MIN_ADULT }", "condition": "${ .applicant | .age < $CONST.AGE.MIN_ADULT }", ... Note that constants can also be used in expression functions,for example: "operation": ".applicant | .age >= $CONST.AGE.MIN_ADULT", "operation": ".applicant | .age < $CONST.AGE.MIN_ADULT", Workflow constants values should only contain static data, meaning that their value should notcontain Workflow expressions.Workflow constants data must be immutable.Workflow constants should not have access to Workflow secrets definitions. Secrets allow you access sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, ssh keys, etcinside your Workflow Expressions. You can define the names of secrets via the Workflow top-level "secrets" property,for example: If secrets are defined in a Workflow definition, runtimes must assure to provide their valuesduring Workflow execution. Secrets can be used only in Workflow expressions by referencing them via the $SECRETS variable.Runtimes must make $SECRETS available to expressions as a predefined variable. Here is an example on how to use secrets and pass them as arguments to a function invocation: "secrets": ["AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT", "AZURE_STORAGE_KEY"], "refName": "uploadToAzure", "account": "${ $SECRETS.AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT }", "account-key": "${ $SECRETS.AZURE_STORAGE_KEY }", ... Note that secrets can also be used in expression functions. Secrets are immutable, meaning that workflow expressions are not allowed to change their values. Metadata enables you to enrich the serverless workflow model with information beyond its core definitions.It is intended to be used by clients, such as tools and libraries, as well as users that find this information relevant. Metadata should not affect Workflow Execution. Implementations may choose to use metadata information or ignore it.Note, however, that using metadata to control Workflow Execution can lead to vendor-locked implementations that do not comply with the main goals of this specification, which is to be completely vendor-neutral. Metadata includes key/value pairs (string types). Both keys and values are completely arbitrary and non-identifying. Metadata can be added to: Function definitions Event definitions State definitions Switch state data and event conditions. Here is an example of metadata attached to the core workflow definition: "id": "processSalesOrders", "name": "Process Sales Orders", "start": "MyStartingState", "category": "Sales", "giturl": "github.com/myproject", "author": "Author Name", "team": "Team Name", ... Some other examples of information that could be recorded in metadata are: UI tooling information such as sizing or scaling factors. Build, release, or image information such as timestamps, release ids, git branches, PR numbers, etc. Logging, monitoring, analytics, or audit repository information. Labels used for organizing/indexing purposes, such as "release" "stable", "track", "daily", etc. Similar to Constants and Secrets, workflows expressions can have access to the context information of a running instance via the keyword WORKFLOW. Implementations may use this keyword to give access to any relevant information of the running instance within an expression. For example: "functions": [{ "name": "myFunction", "operation": "myopenapi.json#myFunction" }], "states":[ "name":"MyStartingState", "type":"operation", "actions": [{ "functionRef": "myFunction", "args": { "order": "${ .orderId }", "callerId": "${ $WORKFLOW.instanceId }" }] In this use case, a third-party service may require information from the caller for traceability purposes. The specification doesn't define any specific variable within the WORKFLOW bucket, but it's considered a reserved keyword. The workflow extension mechanism allows you to enhance your model definitions with additional information useful forthings like analytics, rate limiting, logging, simulation, debugging, tracing, etc. Model extensions do no influence control flow logic (Workflow Execution semantics).They enhance it with extra information that can be consumed by runtime systems or tooling andevaluated with the end goal being overall workflow improvements in terms of time, cost, efficiency, etc. Serverless Workflow specification provides extensions which can be found here. You can define extensions in your workflow definition using its top-level extensions property.For more information about this property, see the extensions property in theWorkflow Definition Structure section. Even tho users can define their own extensions, it is encouraged to use the ones provided by the specification.We also encourage users to contribute their extensions to the specification. That way they can be sharedwith the rest of the community. If you have an idea for a new workflow extension, or would like to enhance an existing one,please open an New Extension Request issue in this repository.

They can come from a database, service, file, or be generated in-memory. To add a new dataset in Visual Studio: Right click on the Data Sources folder in Solution Explorer and select Add New Data Source. Choose the data source type (database, service, object, etc). Configure the connection and select the specific database/tables/objects to include. The Dataset Designer allows you to visually shape and configure datasets: Drag tables/objects onto the designer surface to include them. Set primary keys, foreign keys, relations, column data types. Preview and filter the data. Typed Datasets provide a strongly-typed collection of objects to access data: Drag tables onto the Typed Dataset designer. It generates strongly-typed classes to represent each table. You can then program against the strongly-typed dataset. TableAdapters in typed datasets expose methods like Fill, Insert, Update, Delete to manipulate data. You can customize and extend typed datasets, for example: Add custom methods or properties. Add validation logic. Add relations between tables. Generate custom SQL queries. So in summary, Visual Studio provides a graphical way to create datasets from data sources, configure them, and generate strongly-typed code for programming against the data. The Dataset Designer and Typed Dataset features are key tools for this. .md Python .md : import os from pathlib import Path repo_path = Path('/path/to/repo') md_files = [] for root, dirs, files in os.walk(repo_path): for file in files: if file.endswith('.md'): file_path = os.path.join(root, file) md_files.append(file_path) print(f'Found {len(md_files)} .md files') for file in md_files: with open(file, 'r') as f: content = f.read() print(f'Scanned file {file}') : os.walk. md_files .md . .md (, ). . GitHub, GitLab . https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io/container_registry/1746675 Here are the key points about the GitLab container registry link you shared: It is a container registry hosted on GitLab at https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io/container_registry The specific image it links to is graphviz/graphviz:latest This appears to be a Docker image for Graphviz - an open source graph visualization software. The Dockerfile for this image is available in the repository here: https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io/-/blob/master/Dockerfile It builds Graphviz from source code and installs it into a Ubuntu base image. It exposes ports 8080 and 8081 for web visualization of graphs. The image description states it can be used to generate graphs from DOT language scripts. This Docker image allows running Graphviz in a portable containerized environment. It can be pulled with docker pull registry.gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io:latest And run like: docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 registry.gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io:latest So in summary, this GitLab container registry link points to an official Docker image for running the Graphviz graph visualization software. The image is built from source and exposes web ports to view generated graphs. Read 10 files Unfortunately I do not have access to run Docker containers directly. However, based on the GitLab container registry link and Docker run command you provided, here is a summary: The command docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 registry.gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io:latest would run the Graphviz Docker image hosted at the GitLab container registry. Specifically: registry.gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io:latest refers to the Docker image location. -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 maps ports 8080 and 8081 from the container to the host machine. This allows accessing the Graphviz web visualization server on those ports after running the container. The image can be pulled with docker pull registry.gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io:latest Once running, Graphviz can be used to generate graphs by passing DOT language scripts to the web UI or API exposed on ports 8080 and 8081.

First, Iam going to explain what Midjourney is and what it can do. Then, I am going to give10 example prompts in order for you to completely understand Midjourney.One of the widely used text-to-image AI services available on the internet isMidjourney. Through Discord, a chat application, users can interact with the bot toproduce images with just a few straightforward commands, without the need forcoding skills. The results are visually attractive images that are easy to create.You can Interact with the Midjourney Bot on Discord using a {{glossary.Command}}.Commands are used to create images, change default settings, monitor user info,and perform other helpful tasks.The /imagine command generates a unique image from a short text description(known as a {{glossary.Prompt}}).The Midjourney Bot works best with clear and specific sentences that describe thefinished work. It does not work well with conversational style lists of requests. Ratherthan providing specific instructions, such as 'Show me a picture of lots of bloomingCalifornia poppies, make them bright, vibrant orange, and draw them in anillustrated style with colored pencils,' try describing what you want in a morestraightforward manner, such as 'Vibrant orange California poppies illustrated withcolored pencils.Generating an image activates the free Midjourney trial.Trial users can make roughly25 Jobs before needing to subscribe. A Job is any action that uses the MidjourneyBot. Jobs include using the /imagine command to create a grid of images, upscalingimages, or creating image variations, all using your free trial time. Use the /infocommand to check your Fast Time Remaining to see your remaining Trial time.Here are some prompting notes:Prompt LengthPrompts can be very simple. Single words (or even an emoji!) will produce an image.Very short prompts will rely heavily on Midjourneys default style, so a more descriptive prompt is better for a unique look. However, super-long prompts arentalways better. Concentrate on the main concepts you want to create.GrammarThe Midjourney Bot does not understand grammar, sentence structure, or words likehumans. Word choice also matters. More specific synonyms work better in manycircumstances. Instead of big, try gigantic, enormous, or immense. Remove wordswhen possible. Fewer words mean each word has a more powerful influence. Usecommas, brackets, and hyphens to help organize your thoughts, but know theMidjourney Bot will not reliably interpret them. The Midjourney Bot does notconsider capitalization. Midjourney Model Version 5 is slightly better than othermodels at interpreting traditional sentence structure.Focus on What you WantIt is better to describe what you want instead of what you dont want. If you ask for aparty with no cake, your image will probably include a cake. If you want to ensurean object is not in the final image, try advance prompting using the --no parameter.Think About What Details MatterAnything left unsaid may surprise you. Be as specific or vague as you want, butanything you leave out will be randomized. Being vague is a great way to get variety,but you may not get the specific details you want.Try to be clear about any context or details that are important to you. Thinkabout:Subject: person, animal, character, location, object, etc.Medium: photo, painting, illustration, sculpture, doodle, tapestry, etc.Environment: indoors, outdoors, on the moon, in Narnia, underwater, the EmeraldCity, etc.Lighting: soft, ambient, overcast, neon, studio lights, etcColor: vibrant, muted, bright, monochromatic, colorful, black and white, pastel, etc.Mood: Sedate, calm, raucous, energetic, etc.Composition: Portrait, headshot, closeup, birds-eye view, etc.Use Collective NounsPlural words leave a lot to chance. Try specific numbers. "Three cats" is more specificthan "cats." Collective nouns also work, flock of birds instead of "birds. Parameters AvailableAspect Ratios--aspect, or --ar Change the aspect ratio of a generation.Chaos--chaos <number 0100> Change how varied the results will be. Higher valuesproduce more unusual and unexpected generations.No--no Negative prompting, --no plants would try to remove plants from the image.Quality--quality <.25, .5, 1, or 2>, or --q <.25, .5, 1, or 2> How much rendering quality time youwant to spend. The default value is 1. Higher values cost more and lower values costless.Repeat--repeat <140>, or --r <140> Create multiple Jobs from a single prompt. --repeat isuseful for quickly rerunning a job multiple times.Seed--seed <integer between 04294967295> The Midjourney bot uses a seed number tocreate a field of visual noise, like television static, as a starting point to generate theinitial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can bespecified with the --seed or --sameseed parameter. Using the same seed numberand prompt will produce similar ending images.Stop--stop <integer between 10100> Use the --stop parameter to finish a Job part waythrough the process. Stopping a Job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, lessdetailed results.Style--style <4a, 4b, or 4c> Switch between versions of the Midjourney Model Version 4--style <expressive, or cute> Switch between versions of the Niji Model VersionStylize--stylize, or --s parameter influences how strongly Midjourney'sdefault aesthetic style is applied to Jobs. Uplight--uplight Use an alternative "light" upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The resultsare closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image is less detailed andsmoother.Upbeta--upbeta Use an alternative beta upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The resultsare closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image has significantly feweradded details.Midjourney routinely releases new model versions to improve efficiency, coherency,and quality. Different models excel at different types of images.Niji--niji An alternative model focused on anime style images.Test--test Use the Midjourney special test model.Testp--testp Use the Midjourney special photography-focused test model.Version--version <1, 2, 3, 4, or 5> or --v <1, 2, 3, 4, or 5> Use a different version of the Midjourneyalgorithm. The current algorithm (V4) is the default setting.Now that you understand the basics of MidJourney here are some example promptsto further understand how these are typed out:astronaut playing chess against a monkey, 2d flat, simple, vibrant, neon colors, fun,groovy, chess pieces floating, set on the moon, movie poster, epica magical, vibrant, steampunk, Erlenmeyer Flask with a red, boiling substance, sittingon a white table, white background, 4kjapanese lofi style, the streets of neo tokyo, with a porsche 911 in the street, massiveskyscraper in the background, 64 bit style, shadows and lighting, clean, simple,satisfyingDreamy pastel portrait, female model, long wavy hair, soft gaze, flowery headpiece,delicate makeup, ethereal atmosphere, soft focus, medium format film, MamiyaRZ67, Fujifilm Pro 400H, f3.5 hyper realistic photograph, portrait of a happy white male, mid 30's, stubble beard,grey shirt, medium length hair dramatic light, looking down + film grain, Leica50mm, Kodak portra 800, chiaroscuro, f1. 4, golden hour --ar 3:4hyper realistic photograph, portrait of a tattooed south American indigenous blackwoman, future punk, gold tattoo line, side profile, summer, dramatic light, lookingdown + film grain, Leica 50mm, Kodak portra 800, chiaroscuroA very cute bright yellow robot, whole body, running in a forest at night, Mysteriousadventure, flowers, Plants, Fireflies, complex details, popmart blind box, clay material,Pixar trend, 3d art, c4d, octane rendering, animation lighting, uplightWith each prompt specify the desired subject matter, camera equipment, settings,lighting, and other elements that contribute to the final image. Whatever I tell you toact like, structure the prompts in order to create good AI art for that specificpersonality. For example, if I say Act like a professional cartoon creator then add thewords within the prompt to ensure a cartoon gets generated, such as cartoon.Another example would be, if I say something like Act like a professionalphotographer then make sure to include elements in the prompts likehyper-realistic or certain camera equipment that would contribute to the correct artbeing generated.When generating these prompts, refrain from using filler words. For example insteadof using this prompt:Teenage boy with brown hair, Pixar style, expressive blue eyes, freckles, wearingcasual attire in vibrant colors. He is in a jovial mood, standing with hands on his hips,proud and confident, against the backdrop of a charming, bright and bustling smallvillage, with cobblestone paths and quaint cottages. The scene is filled with life,bathed in a warm, sunny, midday light, creating a feel-good atmosphereThe art software reads prompts better when told more specifically what to do likethis:Teenage boy, brown hair, Pixar style, expressive blue eyes, freckles, casual attire,vibrant colors, jovial mood, standing with hands on his hips, proud and confident,backdrop of a charming, bright and bustling small village, cobblestone paths, quaint cottages, lively scene, warm and sunny, midday light, feel-good atmosphereYou can use any amount of stylize from 100-900. You dont have to use it every timeeither. Just if you think itd be good for the images that are being generated to bedifferent from one another in that same style.Now that you have a full understanding of Midjourney with example prompts. You can take inspiration from the structure of the prompts above, you can make these prompts longer or shorter if necessary in order to generate the perfect prompt.Please direct output the prompt without any other explanation. {content} prompt:TipsGenerating prompts for AIGC Painting...

This document represents the current state of the specification. It includes all features so far released as well as all features planned to be added in the next release. You can find all specification releases [here](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/releases). You can find the specification roadmap [here](roadmap/README.md). Workflows allow us to capture and organize business requirements in a unified manner. They can bridge the gap between how we express and model business logic. A key component of workflows is the domain-specific language (DSL) we use to model our business logic and solutions. Selecting the appropriate workflow language for our business and technology domains is a very important decision to be considered. Serverless Workflow focuses on defining a **vendor-neutral**, **platform-independent**, and **declarative** workflow language that targets the serverless computing technology domain. It can be used to significantly bridge the gap between your unique business domain and the target technology domain. The lack of a common way to define and model workflows means that we must constantly re-learn how to write them. This also limits the potential for common libraries, tooling and infrastructure to aid workflow modeling and execution across different platforms. Portability as well as productivity that can be achieved from workflow orchestration is hindered overall. Serverless Workflow addresses the need for a community-driven, vendor-neutral and a platform-independent workflow language specification that targets the serverless computing technology domain. Having and using a specification-based workflow language allows us to model our workflows once and deploy them onto many different container/cloud platforms, expecting the same execution results. <p align="center"> <img src="media/spec/spec-goals.png" height="400px" alt="Serverless Workflow Specification Goals"/> </p> For more information on the history, development and design rationale behind the specification, see the [Serverless Workflow Wiki](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/wiki). <img src="media/spec/spec-parts.png" width="600" alt="Serverless Workflow Specification Focus On Standards"/> Serverless Workflow language takes advantage of well-established and known standards such as [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/), [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specifications, [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). <img src="media/spec/spec-overview.png" height="400px" alt="Serverless Workflow Specification Overview"/> * Definitions of the workflow language. This is defined via the [Workflow JSON Schema](schema/workflow.json). You can use both [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) and [YAML](https://yaml.org/) formats to model your workflows. * Software Development Kits (SDKs) for [Go](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-go), [Java](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-java), [.NET](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-net), [Typescript](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-typescript) and [Python](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-python), and we plan to add them for more languages in the future. * Set of [Workflow Extensions](extensions/README.md) which allow users to define additional, non-execution-related workflow information. This information can be used to improve workflow performance. Some example workflow extensions include Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), Rate Limiting, Simulation, Tracing, etc. * Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) to be used as a specification conformance tool for runtime implementations. A workflow definition is a JSON or YAML file that conforms to the Serverless Workflow specification DSL. It consists of the core [Workflow Definition Structure](#Workflow-Definition-Structure) and the [Workflow Model](#Workflow-Model) It defines a blueprint used by runtimes for its execution. A business solution can be composed of any number of related workflow definitions. Their relationships are explicitly modeled with the Serverless Workflow language (for example by using [SubFlowRef Definition](#SubFlowRef-Definition) in actions). A workflow instance represents a single Workflow Execution corresponding to the instructions provided by a workflow definition. A workflow instance can be short or long-running. A single workflow instance should be isolated, meaning it should not share state and data with other workflow instances. Workflow instances should be able to communicate with each other via events. Depending on their workflow definition, workflow instances can be short-lived or can execute for days, weeks, or years. Each workflow instances should have its unique identifier, which should remain unchanged throughout its execution. Workflow instances can be started providing some data input. This is described in detail in the [workflow data input](#Workflow-Data-Input) section. Workflow instances can also wait for examples to start their execution, which is the case where a workflow definition contains a [EventState](#Event-State) starting workflow state. The workflow definition also explicitly defines when a workflow instance should be completed. By default, instances should be completed once there are no active workflow paths (all active paths reach a state containing the default [end definition](#End-Definition)), or if the defined [`workflowExecTimeout`](#Workflow-Timeouts) time is reached. Other ways, such as using the `terminate` property of the [end definition](#End-Definition) to terminate instance execution, or defining an [`workflowExecTimeout`](#Workflow-Timeouts) property are also possible. For long-running workflow-executions, you can utilize the `keepActive` workflow property which provides more control as to when exactly to terminate Workflow Execution. In cases where a Workflow Execution should be continued as a new one, the DSL also provides the `continueAs` property which is described in detail in the [Continuing a new Execution](#Continuing-as-a-new-Execution) section. * [Function definitions](#Function-Definition) - Reusable functions that can declare services that need to be invoked, or expressions to be evaluated. * [Event definitions](#Event-Definition) - Reusable declarations of events that need to be `consumed` to start or continue workflow instances, trigger function/service execution, or be `produced` during Workflow Execution. * [Retry definitions](#Retry-Definition) - Reusable retry definitions. Can specify retry strategies for service invocations during Workflow Execution. * [Timeout definitions](#Workflow-Timeouts) - Reusable timeout definitions. Can specify default Workflow Execution timeout, as well as workflow state, action, and branch execution timeouts. * [Errors definition](#Defining-Errors) - Reusable error definitions. Provide domain-specific error definitions which can be referenced in workflow states error handling. * [State definitions](#Workflow-States) - Definition of states, the building blocks of workflow `control flow logic`. States can reference the reusable function, event and retry definitions. Serverless Workflow data is represented in [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) format. Data flow and execution logic go hand in hand, meaning as Workflow Execution follows the workflow definition logic, so does the workflow data: <img src="media/spec/workflowdataflow.png" height="400" alt="Serverless Workflow Data Flow"/> The initial [Workflow data input](#Workflow-data-input) is passed to the workflow starting state as its data input. When a state finishes its execution, [its data output is passed as data input to the next state](#Information-passing-Between-States) that should be executed. When Workflow Execution ends, the last executed workflow state's data output becomes the final [Workflow data output](#Workflow-data-output). States can filter their data inputs and outputs using [State Data filters](#State-data-filters). States can also consume events as well as invoke services. These event payloads and service invocation results can be filtered using [Event data filters](#Event-data-filters) and [Action data filters](#Action-data-filters). Data filters use [workflow expressions](#Workflow-Expressions) for selecting and manipulating state data input and output, action inputs and results, and event payloads. Multiple filters can be combined to gain high level of control of your workflow state data. You can find an example of that in [this](#Using-multiple-data-filters) section. Data from consumed events,and action execution results are added/merged to state data. Reference the [data merging section](#Data-Merging) to learn about the merging rules that should be applied. The initial data input into a workflow instance. Must be a valid [JSON object](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-4). If no input is provided, the default data input should be an empty JSON object: ```json <img src="media/spec/workflowdatainput.png" height="350px" alt="Workflow data input"/> States in a workflow can receive data (data input) and produce a data result (data output). The state's data input is typically the previous state's data output. When a state completes its execution, its data output is passed to the state's data input it transitions to. There are two rules to consider here: - If the state is the workflow starting state, its data input is the [workflow data input](#Workflow-data-input). - When Workflow Execution ends, the data output of the last executed state becomes the [workflow data output](#Workflow-data-output). <img src="media/spec/basic-state-data-passing.png" height="350px" alt="Basic state data passing"/> Each Workflow Execution should produce a data output. The workflow data output is the data output of the last executed workflow state. | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | input | Workflow expression to filter the states data input | string | no | | output | Workflow expression that filters the states data output | string | no | <details><summary><strong>Click to view example definition</strong></summary> <p> <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <td valign="top"> </td> ```yaml </table> </details> The state data filters `input` property expression is applied when the workflow transitions to the current state and receives its data input. It can be used to select only data that is needed and disregard what is not needed. If `input` is not defined or does not select any parts of the state's data input, its data input is not filtered. The state data filter `output` property expression is applied right before the state transitions to the next state defined. It filters the state's data output to be passed as data input to the transitioning state. If the current state is the workflow end state, the filtered state's data output becomes the workflow data output. If `output` is not defined or does not select any parts of the state's data output, its data output is not filtered. Results of the `input` expression should become the state data input. Results of the `output` expression should become the state data output. For more information on this you can reference the [data merging](#Data-Merging) section. For the first example, our state only cares about fruits data, and we want to disregard the vegetables. To do this we can define a state filter: <img src="media/spec/state-data-filter-example1.png" height="400px" alt="State Data Filter Example"/> For our second example, let's say that we are interested in the only vegetable "veggie-like". Here we have two ways of filtering our data, depending on if actions within our state need access to all vegetables, or only the ones that are "veggie-like". The states data input filter selects all the vegetables from the main data input. Once all actions have performed, before the state transition or Workflow Execution completion (if this is an end state), the "output" of the state filter selects only the vegetables which are "veggie like". <img src="media/spec/state-data-filter-example2.png" height="400px" alt="State Data Filter Example"/> | fromStateData | Workflow expression that filters state data that can be used by the action | string | no | | useResults | If set to `false`, action data results are not added/merged to state data. In this case 'results' and 'toStateData' should be ignored. Default is `true`. | boolean | no | | results | Workflow expression that filters the actions data results | string | no | | toStateData | Workflow expression that selects a state data element to which the action results should be added/merged into. If not specified denotes the top-level state data element | string | no | Action data filters can be used inside [Action definitions.](#Action-Definition) Each action can define this filter which can: * Filter the state data to select only the data that can be used within function definition arguments using its `fromStateData` property. * Filter the action results to select only the result data that should be added/merged back into the state data using its `results` property. * Select the part of state data which the action data results should be added/merged to using the `toStateData` property. To give an example, let's say we have an action which returns a list of breads and pasta types. For our workflow, we are only interested into breads and not the pasta. The `results` will filter the action results, which would then be: In this case, our `results` select the first bread and the second element of the pasta array. The `toStateData` expression then selects the `itemsToBuyAtStore` array of the state data to add/merge these results into. With this, after our action executes the state data would be: In the case action results should not be added/merged to state data, we can set the `useResults` property to `false`. In this case, the `results` and `toStateData` properties should be ignored, and nothing is added/merged to state data. If `useResults` is not specified (or it's value set to `true`), action results, if available, should be added/merged to state data. | useData | If set to `false`, event payload is not added/merged to state data. In this case 'data' and 'toStateData' should be ignored. Default is `true`. | boolean | no | | data | Workflow expression that filters the event data (payload) | string | no | Event data filters can be used to filter consumed event payloads. They can be used to: * Filter the event payload to select only the data that should be added/merged into the state data using its `data` property. * Select the part of state data into which the event payload should be added/merged into Allows event data to be filtered and added to or merged with the state data. All events have to be in the CloudEvents format and event data filters can filter both context attributes and the event payload (data) using the `data` property. <img src="media/spec/event-data-filter-example1.png" height="400px" alt="Event Data Filter Example"/> Note that the data input to the Event data filters depends on the `dataOnly` property of the associated [Event definition](#Event-Definition). If this property is not defined (has default value of `true`), Event data filter expressions are evaluated against the event payload (the CloudEvents `data` attribute only). If it is set to `false`, the expressions should be evaluated against the entire CloudEvent (including its context attributes). In the case event data/payload should not be added/merged to state data, we can set the `useData` property to `false`. In this case, the `data` and `toStateData` properties should be ignored, and nothing is added/merged to state data. If `useData` is not specified (or it's value set to `true`), event payload, if available, should be added/merged to state data. As [Event states](#Event-State) can take advantage of all defined data filters. In the example below, we define a workflow with a single event state and show how data filters can be combined. "spanish": "Adios", Here is a sample diagram showing our workflow, each numbered step on this diagram shows a certain defined point during Workflow Execution at which data filters are invoked and correspond to the numbered items below. <img src="media/spec/using-multiple-filters-example.png" height="400px" alt="Using Multple Filters Example"/> **(1) Workflow execution starts**: Workflow data is passed to our "WaitForCustomerToArrive" event state as data input. Workflow executes its starting state, namely the "WaitForCustomerToArrive" event state. The event state **stateDataFilter** is invoked to filter its data input. The filters "input" expression is evaluated and selects only the "greetings" data. The rest of the state data input should be disregarded. "spanish": "Adios", **(2) CloudEvent of type "customer-arrival-type" is consumed**: Once the event is consumed, the "eventDataFilter" is triggered. Its "data" expression selects the "customer" object from the events data. The "toStateData" expression says that we should add/merge this selected event data to the state data in its "customerInfo" property. If this property exists it should be merged, if it does not exist, one should be created. "spanish": "Adios", **(3) Event state performs its actions**: Before the first action is executed, its actionDataFilter is invoked. Its "fromStateData" expression filters the current state data to select from its data that should be available to action arguments. In this example it selects the "hello" and "customerInfo" properties from the current state data. At this point the action is executed. We assume that for this example "greetingFunction" returns: The action filters "toStateData" expression then defines that we want to add/merge this action result to state data under the "finalCustomerGreeting" element. **(4) Event State Completes Execution**: When our event state finishes its execution, the states "stateDataFilter" "output" filter expression is executed to filter the state data to create the final state data output. Because our event state is also an end state, its data output becomes the final [workflow data output](#Workflow-data-output). Namely: Consumed event data (payload) and action execution results should be merged into the state data. Event and action data filters can be used to give more details about this operation. By default, with no data filters specified, when an event is consumed, its entire data section (payload) should be merged to the state data. Merging should be applied to the entire state data JSON element. In case of event and action filters, their "toStateData" property can be defined to select a specific element of the state data with which merging should be done against. If this element does not exist, a new one should be created first. When merging, the state data element and the data (payload)/action result should have the same type, meaning that you should not merge arrays with objects or objects with arrays etc. When merging elements of type object should be done by inserting all the key-value pairs from both objects into a single combined object. If both objects contain a value for the same key, the object of the event data/action results should "win". To give an example, let's say we have the following state data: Merging array types should be done by concatenating them into a larger array including unique elements of both arrays. To give an example, merging: Merging number types should be done by overwriting the data from events data/action results into the merging element of the state data. For example merging action results: Workflow [functions](#Function-Definition) are reusable definitions for service invocations and/or expression evaluation. They can be referenced by their domain-specific names inside workflow [states](#Workflow-States). * [Using functions for RESTful service invocations](#Using-Functions-for-RESTful-Service-Invocations) * [Using Functions for Async API Service Invocations](#Using-Functions-for-Async-API-Service-Invocations) * [Using functions for gRPC service invocation](#Using-Functions-For-RPC-Service-Invocations) * [Using functions for GraphQL service invocation](#Using-Functions-For-GraphQL-Service-Invocations) * [Using Functions for OData Service Invocations](#Using-Functions-for-OData-Service-Invocations) * [Using functions for expression evaluations](#Using-Functions-For-Expression-Evaluation) * [Defining custom function types](#defining-custom-function-types) We can define if functions are invoked sync or async. Reference the [functionRef](#FunctionRef-Definition) to learn more on how to do this. [Functions](#Function-Definition) can be used to describe services and their operations that need to be invoked during Workflow Execution. They can be referenced by states [action definitions](#Action-Definition) to clearly define when the service operations should be invoked during Workflow Execution, as well as the data parameters passed to them if needed. Note that with Serverless Workflow, we can also define invocation of services which are triggered via an event. To learn more about that, please reference the [event definitions](#Event-Definition) section, as well as the [actions definitions](#Action-Definition) [eventRef](#EventRef-Definition) property. Because of an overall lack of a common way to describe different services and their operations, many workflow languages typically chose to define custom function definitions. This approach, however, often runs into issues such as lack of portability, limited capabilities, as well as forcing non-workflow-specific information, such as service authentication, to be added inside the workflow language. To avoid these issues, the Serverless Workflow specification mandates that details about RESTful services and their operations be described using the [OpenAPI Specification](https://www.openapis.org/). OpenAPI is a language-agnostic standard that describes discovery of RESTful services. This allows Serverless Workflow language to describe RESTful services in a portable way, as well as workflow runtimes to utilize OpenAPI tooling and APIs to invoke service operations. It can, as previously mentioned be referenced during Workflow Execution when the invocation of this service is desired. For example: Note that the referenced function definition type in this case must be `rest` (default type). For more information about functions, reference the [Functions definitions](#Function-Definition) section. [Functions](#Function-Definition) can be used to invoke PUBLISH and SUBSCRIBE operations on a message broker documented by the [Async API Specification](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/v2.1.0). [Async API operations](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/v2.1.0#operationObject) are bound to a [channel](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/v2.1.0#definitionsChannel) which describes the technology, security mechanisms, input and validation to be used for their execution. Let's take a look at a hypothetical Async API document (assumed its stored locally with the file name `streetlightsapi.yaml`) and define a single publish operation: To define a workflow action invocation, we can then use the following workflow [Function Definition](#Function-Definition) and set the `operation` to `onLightMeasured`: Note that the [Function Definition](#Function-Definition)'s `operation` property must have the following format: ```text Also note that the referenced function definition type in this case must have the value `asyncapi`. Our defined function definition can then we referenced in a workflow [action](#Action-Definition), for example: Similar to defining invocations of operations on RESTful services, you can also use the workflow [functions definitions](#Function-Definition) that follow the remote procedure call (RPC) protocol. For RPC invocations, the Serverless Workflow specification mandates that they are described using [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), a widely used RPC system. gRPC uses [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) to define messages, services, and the methods on those services that can be invoked. Let's look at an example of invoking a service method using RPC. For this example let's say we have the following gRPC protocol buffer definition in a myuserservice.proto file: Note that the `operation` property has the following format: Note that the referenced function definition type in this case must be `rpc`. We'll use the following [GraphQL schema definition](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/) to show how that would work with both a query and a mutation: ```graphql In our workflow definition, we can then use a function definition for the `pet` query field as such: Note that the `operation` property has the following format for the `graphql` type: In order to invoke this query, we would use the following `functionRef` parameters: With the parameters for the `functionRef`: Note you can include [expressions](#Workflow-Expressions) in both `arguments` and `selectionSet`: Similar to defining invocations of operations on GraphQL services, you can also use workflow [Functions Definitions](#Function-Definition) to execute complex queries on an [OData](https://www.odata.org/documentation/) service. We start off by creating a workflow [Functions Definitions](#Function-Definition). For example: Note that the `operation` property must follow the following format: In order to invoke the defined [OData](https://www.odata.org/documentation/) function, simply reference it in a workflow [Action Definition](#Action-Definition) and set its function arguments. For example: In order to ensure compatibility of OData support across runtimes, the`arguments` property of an [OData](https://www.odata.org/documentation/) function reference should follow the Serverless Workflow [OData Json schema](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/tree/main/schema/odata.json) In addition to defining RESTful, AsyncAPI, RPC, GraphQL and OData services and their operations, workflow [functions definitions](#Function-Definition) can also be used to define expressions that should be evaluated during Workflow Execution. Defining expressions as part of function definitions has the benefit of being able to reference them by their logical name through workflow states where expression evaluation is required. Expression functions must declare their `type` parameter to be `expression`. Here we define two reusable expression functions. Expressions in Serverless Workflow can be evaluated against the workflow, or workflow state data. Note that different data filters play a big role as to which parts of the workflow data are being evaluated by the expressions. Reference the [State Data Filters](#State-data-filters) section for more information on this. Our expression functions can also be referenced and executed as part of state [action](#Action-Definition) execution. Let's say we have the following workflow definition: The starting [inject state](#Inject-State) "Initialize Count" injects the count element into our state data, which then becomes the state data input of our "Increment Count" [operation state](#Operation-State). This state defines an invocation of the "Increment Count Function" expression function defined in our workflow definition. This triggers the evaluation of the defined expression. The input of this expression is by default the current state data. Just like with "rest", and "rpc" type functions, expression functions also produce a result. In this case the result of the expression is just the number 1. The actions filter then assigns this result to the state data element "count" and the state data becomes: ``` json Note that the used function definition type in this case must be `expression`. For more information about workflow expressions, reference the [Workflow Expressions](#Workflow-Expressions) section. [Function definitions](#function-definition) `type` property defines a list of function types that are set by the specification. Some runtime implementations might support additional function types that extend the ones defined in the specification. In those cases you can define a custom function type with for example: In this example we define a custom function type that is meant to execute an external [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) script. When a custom function type is specified, the operation property value has a **custom format**, meaning that its format is controlled by the runtime which provides the custom function type. Note that different data filters play a big role as to which parts of the states data are to be used when the expression is evaluated. Reference the [State Data Filtering](#State-data-filters) section for more information about state data filters. By default, all workflow expressions should be defined using the [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) [version 1.6](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases/tag/jq-1.6) syntax. You can find more information on jq in its [manual](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/). Serverless Workflow does not mandate the use of jq and it's possible to use an expression language of your choice with the restriction that a single one must be used for all expressions in a workflow definition. If a different expression language needs to be used, make sure to set the workflow `expressionLang` property to identify it to runtime implementations. Note that using a non-default expression language could lower the portability of your workflow definitions across multiple container/cloud platforms. All workflow expressions in this document, [specification examples](examples/README.md) as well as [comparisons examples](comparisons/README.md) are written using the default jq syntax. Where `expression` can be either an in-line expression, or a reference to a defined [expression function definition](#Using-Functions-For-Expression-Evaluation). To reference a defined [expression function definition](#Using-Functions-For-Expression-Evaluation) the expression must have the following format, for example: Where `fn` is the namespace of the defined expression functions and `myExprName` is the unique expression function name. We will get back to this function definition in just a bit, but now let's take a look at using an inline expression that sets an input parameter inside an action for example: In this case our input parameter `applicantName` would be set to "John Doe". Expressions can also be used to select and manipulate state data, this is in particularly useful for state data filters. [Switch state](#Switch-State) [conditions](#Switch-State-Data-Conditions) require for expressions to be resolved to a boolean value (`true`/`false`). As previously mentioned, expressions are evaluated against certain subsets of data. For example the `parameters` param of the [functionRef definition](#FunctionRef-Definition) can evaluate expressions only against the data that is available to the [action](#Action-Definition) it belongs to. One thing to note here are the top-level [workflow definition](#Workflow-Definition-Structure) parameters. Expressions defined in them can only be evaluated against the initial [workflow data input](#Workflow-Data-Input). which would set the workflow version to "1.0.0". Note that the workflow "id" property value is not allowed to use an expression. The workflow definition "id" must be a constant value. | --- | --- | --- | --- | | id | Workflow unique identifier | string | yes (if `key` is not defined) | | key | Domain-specific workflow identifier | string | yes (if `id` is not defined) | | name | Workflow name | string | no | | description | Workflow description | string | no | | version | Workflow version. MUST respect the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) format | string | no | | annotations | List of helpful terms describing the workflows intended purpose, subject areas, or other important qualities | array | no | | dataInputSchema | Used to validate the workflow data input against a defined JSON Schema| string or object | no | | dataOutputSchema | Used to validate the workflow data output against a defined JSON Schema| string or object | no | | [constants](#Workflow-Constants) | Workflow constants | string or object | no | | [secrets](#Workflow-Secrets) | Workflow secrets | string or array | no | | [start](#Start-Definition) | Workflow start definition | string or object | no | | specVersion | Serverless Workflow specification release version | string | yes | | expressionLang | Identifies the expression language used for workflow expressions. Default value is "jq" | string | no | | [timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) | Defines the workflow default timeout settings | string or object | no | | [errors](#Defining-Errors) | Defines checked errors that can be explicitly handled during Workflow Execution | string or array | no | | keepActive | If `true`, workflow instances is not terminated when there are no active execution paths. Instance can be terminated with "terminate end definition" or reaching defined "workflowExecTimeout" | boolean | no | | [auth](#Auth-Definition) | Workflow authentication definitions | array or string | no | | [events](#Event-Definition) | Workflow event definitions. | array or string | no | | [functions](#Function-Definition) | Workflow function definitions. Can be either inline function definitions (if array) or URI pointing to a resource containing json/yaml function definitions (if string) | array or string| no | | autoRetries | If set to `true`, [actions](#Action-Definition) should automatically be retried on unchecked errors. Default is `false` | boolean| no | | [retries](#Retry-Definition) | Workflow retries definitions. Can be either inline retries definitions (if array) or URI pointing to a resource containing json/yaml retry definitions (if string) | array or string| no | | [states](#Workflow-States) | Workflow states | array | yes | | [extensions](#Extensions) | Workflow extensions definitions | array or string | no | | [metadata](#Workflow-Metadata) | Metadata information | object | no | Defines the top-level structure of a serverless workflow model. Following figure describes the main workflow definition blocks. <img src="media/spec/workflowdefinitionblocks.png" height="300px" alt="Serverless Workflow Definitions Blocks"/> The `id` property defines the unique, domain-specific workflow identifier, for example "orders", "payment", etc. The `key` property defines the unique, domain-specific workflow identifier. It can be used when the `id` property is auto-generated by a content-management system for example. In these cases, you can specify the `key` property to be the domain-specific identifier of the workflow definition. The `id` and `key` properties are mutually exclusive, meaning you cannot define both. The `name` property is the workflow logical name. The `description` property can be used to give further information about the workflow. The `version` property can be used to provide a specific workflow version. It must use the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) format. The `annotations` property defines a list of helpful terms describing the workflows intended purpose, subject areas, or other important qualities, for example "machine learning", "monitoring", "networking", etc The `dataInputSchema` and `dataOutputSchema` properties can be used to validate input and output data against a defined JSON Schema. The `dataInputSchema` property validates the [workflow data input](#Workflow-Data-Input). Validation should be performed before any states are executed. In case of a start [Event state](#Event-state) the input schema is ignored, if present. The `failOnValidationErrors` property determines if Workflow Execution should continue in case of validation errors. The `dataOutputSchema` property validates the [Workflow data output](#workflow-data-output). Validation is performed on the output of the Workflow Execution. The `failOnValidationErrors` property determines what should be done when the workflow output does not match the provided schema. If `failOnValidationErrors` is true, an error should be thrown. If executed within a subprocess, that error can be be handled by the parent workflow. If `failOnValidationErrors` is false, the error should not be propagated. It is up to the implementor to warn the user about that fact. For example, printing a log. Both properties can be expressed as object or string type. If using object type, their `schema` property might be an URI, which points to the JSON schema used to validate the workflow data input, or it might be the JSON schema object. `failOnValidationErrors` is optional, default value is `true`. If using string type, then the string value is the external schema URI and `failOnValidationErrors` default value of `true` is assumed. The `secrets` property allows you to use sensitive information such as passwords, OAuth tokens, ssh keys, etc. inside your Workflow expressions. It has two possible types, `string` or `array`. If `string` type, it is an URI pointing to a JSON or YAML document which contains an array of names of the secrets, for example: If `array` type, it defines an array (of string types) which contains the names of the secrets, for example: For more information about Workflow secrets, reference the [Workflow Secrets section](#Workflow-Secrets). The `constants` property can be used to define Workflow constants values which are accessible in [Workflow Expressions](#Workflow-Expressions). It has two possible types, `string` or `object`. which contains an object of global definitions, for example: If `object` type, it defines a JSON object which contains the constants definitions, for example: For more information see the [Workflow Constants](#Workflow-Constants) section. The `start` property defines the workflow starting information. For more information see the [start definition](#Start-Definition) section. This property is not required. If not defined, the workflow starting state has to be the very first state defined in the [workflow states array](#Workflow-States). The `specVersion` property is used to set the Serverless Workflow specification release version the workflow markup adheres to. It has to follow the specification release versions (excluding the leading "v"), meaning that for the [release version v0.8](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/releases/tag/v0.8) its value should be set to `"0.8"`. The `expressionLang` property can be used to identify the expression language used for all expressions in the workflow definition. The default value of this property is ["jq"](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/). You should set this property if you chose to define [workflow expressions](#Workflow-Expressions) with an expression language / syntax other than the default. The `timeouts` property is used to define the default workflow timeouts for workflow, state, action, and branch execution. For more information about timeouts and its use cases see the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section. The `error` property is used to define checked errors that can be explicitly handled during Workflow Execution. For more information about workflow error handling see [this section](#Defining-Errors). The `auth` property can be either an inline [auth](#Auth-Definition) definition array, or a URI reference to a resource containing an array of [auth](#Auth-Definition) definitions. If defined in a separate resource file (Json or Yaml), `auth` definitions can be re-used by multiple workflow definitions. Auth definitions can be used to define authentication that should be used to access the resource defined in the `operation` property of the [function](#Function-Definition) definitions. If we have the following function definition: The `authRef` property is used to reference an authentication definition in the `auth` property and should be applied when invoking the `helloWorld` function. An [AuthRef](#AuthRef-Definition) object can alternatively be used to configure the authentication definition to use when accessing the function's resource and/or when invoking the function. The `functions` property can be either an in-line [function](#Function-Definition) definition array, or an URI reference to a resource containing an array of [functions](#Function-Definition) definition. Referenced resource can be used by multiple workflow definitions. 1. Workflow definition: 2. Function definitions resource: Referenced resource must conform to the specifications [Workflow Functions JSON Schema](schema/functions.json). The `events` property can be either an in-line [event](#Event-Definition) definition array, or an [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) reference to a resource containing an array of [event](#Event-Definition) definition. Referenced resource can be used by multiple workflow definitions. 2. Event definitions resource: Referenced resource must conform to the specifications [Workflow Events JSON Schema](schema/events.json). The `retries` property can be either an in-line [retry](#Retry-Definition) definition array, or an URI reference to a resource containing an array of [retry](#Retry-Definition) definition. Referenced resource can be used by multiple workflow definitions. For more information about using and referencing retry definitions see the [Workflow Error Handling](#Workflow-Error-Handling) section. The `keepActive` property allows you to change the default behavior of workflow instances. By default, as described in the [Core Concepts](#Core-Concepts) section, a workflow instance is terminated once there are no more active execution paths, one of its active paths ends in a "terminate" [end definition](#End-Definition), or when its [`workflowExecTimeout`](#Workflow-Timeouts) time is reached. Setting the `keepActive` property to `true` allows you to change this default behavior in that a workflow instance created from this workflow definition can only be terminated if one of its active paths ends in a "terminate" [end definition](#End-Definition), or when This allows you to explicitly model workflows where an instance should be kept alive, to collect (event) data for example. You can reference the [specification examples](#Examples) to see the `keepActive` property in action. The `extensions` property can be used to define extensions for this workflow definition. You can learn more about workflow extensions in the [Extensions](#extensions) section. Sample `extensions` property definition could look like this for example: Here we define two workflow extensions, namely the [rate limiting](extensions/ratelimiting.md) and [kpi](extensions/kpi.md) extensions for our workflow definition. Workflow states define building blocks of the Workflow Execution instructions. They define the control flow logic instructions on what the workflow is supposed to do. Serverless Workflow defines the following Workflow States: | Name | Description | Consumes events? | Produces events? | Executes actions? | Handles errors/retries? | Allows parallel execution? | Makes data-based transitions? | Can be workflow start state? | Can be workflow end state? | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **[Event](#Event-State)** | Define events that trigger action execution | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | no | yes | yes | | **[Operation](#Operation-State)** | Execute one or more actions | no | yes | yes | yes | yes | no | yes | yes | | **[Switch](#Switch-State)** | Define data-based or event-based workflow transitions | no | yes | no | yes | no | yes | yes | no | | **[Sleep](#Sleep-State)** | Sleep Workflow Execution for a specific time duration | no | yes | no | yes | no | no | yes | yes | | **[Parallel](#Parallel-State)** | Causes parallel execution of branches (set of states) | no | yes | no | yes | yes | no | yes | yes | | **[Inject](#Inject-State)** | Inject static data into state data | no | yes | no | yes | no | no | yes | yes | | **[ForEach](#ForEach-State)** | Parallel execution of states for each element of a data array | no | yes | no | yes | yes | no | yes | yes | | **[Callback](#Callback-State)** | Manual decision step. Executes a function and waits for callback event that indicates completion of the manual decision | yes | yes | yes | yes | no | no | yes | yes | | name | Unique State name | string | yes | | type | State type | string | yes | | exclusive | If `true`, consuming one of the defined events causes its associated actions to be performed. If `false`, all of the defined events must be consumed in order for actions to be performed. Default is `true` | boolean | no | | [onEvents](#OnEvents-Definition) | Define the events to be consumed and optional actions to be performed | array | yes | | [timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) | State specific timeout settings | object | no | | [stateDataFilter](#State-data-filters) | State data filter definition| object | no | | [transition](#Transitions) | Next transition of the workflow after all the actions have been performed | string or object | yes (if `end` is not defined) | | [onErrors](#Error-Definition) | States error handling definitions | array | no | | [end](#End-Definition) | Is this state an end state | boolean or object | yes (if `transition` is not defined) | | [compensatedBy](#Workflow-Compensation) | Unique name of a workflow state which is responsible for compensation of this state | string | no | | [metadata](#Workflow-Metadata) | Metadata information| object | no | Event states await one or more events and perform actions when they are received. If defined as the workflow starting state, the event state definition controls when the workflow instances should be created. The `exclusive` property determines if the state should wait for any of the defined events in the `onEvents` array, or if all defined events must be present for their associated actions to be performed. Following two figures illustrate the `exclusive` property: <img src="media/spec/event-state-exclusive-true.png" height="300px" alt="Event state with exclusive set to true"/> If the Event state in this case is a workflow starting state, the occurrence of *any* of the defined events would start a new workflow instance. <img src="media/spec/event-state-exclusive-false.png" height="300px" alt="Event state with exclusive set to false"/> If the Event state in this case is a workflow starting state, the occurrence of *all* defined events would start a new workflow instance. In order to consider only events that are related to each other, we need to set the `correlation` property in the workflow [events definitions](#Event-Definition). This allows us to set up event correlation rules against the events extension context attributes. If the Event state is not a workflow starting state, the `timeout` property can be used to define the time duration from the invocation of the event state. If the defined event, or events have not been received during this time, the state should transition to the next state or can end the Workflow Execution (if it is an end state). The `timeouts` property can be used to define state specific timeout settings. Event states can define the `stateExecTimeout`, `actionExecTimeout`, and `eventTimeout` properties. For more information about Event state specific event timeout settings reference [this section](#Event-Timeout-Definition). For more information about workflow timeouts reference the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section. Note that `transition` and `end` properties are mutually exclusive, meaning that you cannot define both of them at the same time. | actionMode | Should actions be performed sequentially or in parallel. Default is `sequential` | enum | no | | [actions](#Action-Definition) | Actions to be performed | array | yes | | [stateDataFilter](#State-data-filters) | State data filter | object | no | | [onErrors](#Error-Definition) | States error handling and retries definitions | array | no | | [usedForCompensation](#Workflow-Compensation) | If `true`, this state is used to compensate another state. Default is `false` | boolean | no | Operation state defines a set of actions to be performed in sequence or in parallel. Once all actions have been performed, a transition to another state can occur. The `timeouts` property can be used to define state specific timeout settings. Operation states can define the `stateExecTimeout` and `actionExecTimeout` settings. For more information on Workflow timeouts reference the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section. | [dataConditions](#Switch-state-Data-Conditions) | Defined if the Switch state evaluates conditions and transitions based on state data. | array | yes (if `eventConditions` is not defined) | | [eventConditions](#Switch-State-Event-Conditions) | Defined if the Switch state evaluates conditions and transitions based on arrival of events. | array | yes (if `dataConditions` is not defined | | defaultCondition | Default transition of the workflow if there is no matching data conditions or event timeout is reached. Can be a transition or end definition | object | yes | Switch states can be viewed as workflow gateways: they can direct transitions of a workflow based on certain conditions. There are two types of conditions for switch states: * [Data-based conditions](#Switch-State-Data-Conditions) * [Event-based conditions](#Switch-State-Event-Conditions) At times multiple defined conditions can be evaluated to `true` by runtime implementations. Conditions defined first take precedence over conditions defined later. This is backed by the fact that arrays/sequences are ordered in both JSON and YAML. For example, let's say there are two `true` conditions: A and B, defined in that order. Because A was defined first, its transition will be executed, not B's. In case of data-based conditions definition, switch state controls workflow transitions based on the states data. If no defined conditions can be matched, the state transitions is taken based on the `defaultCondition` property. This property can be either a `transition` to another workflow state, or an `end` definition meaning a workflow end. For event-based conditions, a switch state acts as a workflow wait state. It halts Workflow Execution until one of the referenced events arrive, then making a transition depending on that event definition. If events defined in event-based conditions do not arrive before the states `eventTimeout` property expires, state transitions are based on the defined `defaultCondition` property. The `timeouts` property can be used to define state specific timeout settings. Switch states can define the `stateExecTimeout` setting. If `eventConditions` is defined, the switch state can also define the `eventTimeout` property. For more information on workflow timeouts reference the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section. | duration | Duration (ISO 8601 duration format) to sleep. For example: "PT15M" (sleep 15 minutes), or "P2DT3H4M" (sleep 2 days, 3 hours and 4 minutes) | string | yes | | [transition](#Transitions) | Next transition of the workflow after the sleep | string or object | yes (if `end` is not defined) | Sleep state suspends Workflow Execution for a given time duration. The delay is defined in its `duration` property using the ISO 8601 duration format. | [branches](#Parallel-State-Branch) | List of branches for this parallel state| array | yes | | completionType | Option types on how to complete branch execution. Default is "allOf" | enum | no | | numCompleted | Used when branchCompletionType is set to `atLeast` to specify the least number of branches that must complete in order for the state to transition/end. | string or number | yes (if `completionType` is `atLeast`) | | [transition](#Transitions) | Next transition of the workflow after all branches have completed execution | string or object | yes (if `end` is not defined) | Parallel state defines a collection of `branches` that are executed in parallel. A parallel state can be seen a state which splits up the current workflow instance execution path into multiple ones, one for each branch. These execution paths are performed in parallel and are joined back into the current execution path depending on the defined `completionType` parameter value. * allOf: All branches must complete execution before the state can transition/end. This is the default value in case this parameter is not defined in the parallel state definition. * atLeast: State can transition/end once at least the specified number of branches have completed execution. In this case you must also specify the `numCompleted` property to define this number. Exceptions may occur during execution of branches of the Parallel state, this is described in detail in [this section](#Parallel-State-Handling-Exceptions). The `timeouts` property can be used to set state specific timeout settings. Parallel states can define the `stateExecTimeout` and `branchExecTimeout` timeout settings. For more information on workflow timeouts reference the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section. | data | JSON object which can be set as state's data input and can be manipulated via filter | object | yes | | [stateDataFilter](#state-data-filters) | State data filter | object | no | | [transition](#Transitions) | Next transition of the workflow after injection has completed | string or object | yes (if `end` is not defined) | Inject state can be used to inject static data into state data input. Inject state does not perform any actions. It is very useful for debugging, for example, as you can test/simulate Workflow Execution with pre-set data that would typically be dynamic in nature (e.g., function calls, events). The inject state `data` property allows you to statically define a JSON object which gets added to the states data input. You can use the filter property to control the states data output to the transition state. Here is a typical example of how to use the inject state to add static data into its states data input, which then is passed as data output to the transition state: ```json "name":"SimpleInjectState", "type":"inject", "data": { "person": { "fname": "John", "lname": "Doe", "address": "1234 SomeStreet", "age": 40 "transition": "GreetPersonState" ``` If the inject state already receives a data input from the previous transition state, the inject data should be merged with its data input. | inputCollection | Workflow expression selecting an array element of the states data | string | yes | | outputCollection | Workflow expression specifying an array element of the states data to add the results of each iteration | string | no | | iterationParam | Name of the iteration parameter that can be referenced in actions/workflow. For each parallel iteration, this param should contain an unique element of the inputCollection array | string | no | | batchSize | Specifies how many iterations may run in parallel at the same time. Used if `mode` property is set to `parallel` (default). If not specified, its value should be the size of the `inputCollection` | string or number | no | | mode | Specifies how iterations are to be performed (sequentially or in parallel). Default is `parallel` | enum | no | | [actions](#Action-Definition) | Actions to be executed for each of the elements of inputCollection | array | yes | | [stateDataFilter](#State-data-filters) | State data filter definition | object | no | | [transition](#Transitions) | Next transition of the workflow after state has completed | string or object | yes (if `end` is not defined) | ForEach states can be used to execute [actions](#Action-Definition) for each element of a data set. Each iteration of the ForEach state is by default executed in parallel by default. However, executing iterations sequentially is also possible by setting the value of the `mode` property to `sequential`. The `mode` property defines if iterations should be done sequentially or in parallel. By default, if `mode` is not specified, iterations should be done in parallel. If the default `parallel` iteration mode is used, the `batchSize` property to the number of iterations (batch) that can be executed at a time. To give an example, if the number of iterations is 55 and `batchSize` is set to `10`, 10 iterations are to be executed at a time, meaning that the state would execute 10 iterations in parallel, then execute the next batch of 10 iterations. After 5 such executions, the remaining 5 iterations are to be executed in the last batch. The batch size value must be greater than 1. If not specified, its value should be the size of the `inputCollection` (all iterations). The `inputCollection` property is a workflow expression which selects an array in the states data. All iterations are performed against data elements of this array. If this array does not exist, the runtime should throw an error. This error can be handled inside the states [`onErrors`](#Error-Definition) definition. The `outputCollection` property is a workflow expression which selects an array in the state data where the results of each iteration should be added to. If this array does not exist, it should be created. The `iterationParam` property defines the name of the iteration parameter passed to each iteration of the ForEach state. It should contain the unique element of the `inputCollection` array and made available to actions of the ForEach state. `iterationParam` can be accessed as an expression variable. [In JQ, expression variables are prefixed by $](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Variable/SymbolicBindingOperator:...as$identifier|...). If `iterationParam` is not explicitly defined, runtimes should create one and populate it with the value of the unique iteration parameter for each iteration of the ForEach state. The `actions` property defines actions to be executed in each state iteration. The workflow data input containing order information is passed to the `SendConfirmState` [ForEach](#ForEach-State) state. The ForEach state defines an `inputCollection` property which selects all orders that have the `completed` property set to `true`. For each element of the array selected by `inputCollection` a JSON object defined by `iterationParam` should be created containing an unique element of `inputCollection` and passed as the data input to the parallel executed actions. So for this example, we would have two parallel executions of the `sendConfirmationFunction`, the first one having data: The results of each parallel action execution are stored as elements in the state data array defined by the `outputCollection` property. The `timeouts` property can be used to set state specific timeout settings. ForEach states can define the `stateExecTimeout` and `actionExecTimeout` settings. For more information on workflow timeouts reference the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section. | [action](#Action-Definition) | Defines the action to be executed | object | yes | | eventRef | References an unique callback event name in the defined workflow [events](#Event-Definition) | string | yes | | [eventDataFilter](#Event-data-filters) | Callback event data filter definition | object | no | | [transition](#Transitions) | Next transition of the workflow after callback event has been received | string or object | yes (if `end` is not defined) | | [compensatedBy](#Workflow-Compensation) | Uniaue name of a workflow state which is responsible for compensation of this state | string | no | Serverless orchestration can at times require manual steps/decisions to be made. While some work performed in a serverless workflow can be executed automatically, some decisions must involve manual steps (e.g., human decisions). The Callback state allows you to explicitly model manual decision steps during Workflow Execution. The action property defines a function call that triggers an external activity/service. Once the action executes, the callback state will wait for a CloudEvent (defined via the `eventRef` property), which indicates the completion of the manual decision by the called service. Note that the called decision service is responsible for emitting the callback CloudEvent indicating the completion of the decision and including the decision results as part of the event payload. This event must be correlated to the workflow instance using the callback events context attribute defined in the `correlation` property of the referenced [Event Definition](#Event-Definition). Once the completion (callback) event is received, the Callback state completes its execution and transitions to the next defined workflow state or completes Workflow Execution in case it is an end state. The `timeouts` property defines state specific timeout settings. Callback states can define the For more information on workflow timeouts reference the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) | name | Unique function name | string | yes | | operation | If type is `rest`, <path_to_openapi_definition>#<operation_id>. If type is `asyncapi`, <path_to_asyncapi_definition>#<operation_id>. If type is `rpc`, <path_to_grpc_proto_file>#<service_name>#<service_method>. If type is `graphql`, <url_to_graphql_endpoint>#<literal \"mutation\" or \"query\">#<query_or_mutation_name>. If type is `odata`, <URI_to_odata_service>#<Entity_Set_Name>. If type is `expression`, defines the workflow expression. | string | yes | | type | Defines the function type. Can be either `rest`, `asyncapi`, `rpc`, `graphql`, `odata`, `expression`, or [`custom`](#defining-custom-function-types). Default is `rest` | enum | no | | authRef | References an [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) name to be used to access to resource defined in the operation parameter | string | no | | [metadata](#Workflow-Metadata) | Metadata information. Can be used to define custom function information | object | no | The `name` property defines an unique name of the function definition. The `type` property defines the function type. Its value can be either `rest` or `expression`. Default value is `rest`. Depending on the function `type`, the `operation` property can be: * If `type` is `rest`, a combination of the function/service OpenAPI definition document URI and the particular service operation that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'. For example `https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json#getPetById`. * If `type` is `asyncapi`, a combination of the AsyncApi definition document URI and the particular service operation that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'. For example `file://streetlightsapi.yaml#onLightMeasured`. * If `type` is `rpc`, a combination of the gRPC proto document URI and the particular service name and service method name that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'. For example `file://myuserservice.proto#UserService#ListUsers`. * If `type` is `graphql`, a combination of the GraphQL schema definition URI and the particular service name and service method name that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'. For example `file://myuserservice.proto#UserService#ListUsers`. * If `type` is `odata`, a combination of the GraphQL schema definition URI and the particular service name and service method name that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'. For example `https://services.odata.org/V3/OData/OData.svc#Products`. * If `type` is `expression`, defines the expression syntax. Take a look at the [workflow expressions section](#Workflow-Expressions) for more information on this. Defining custom function types is possible, for more information on that refer to the [Defining custom function types](#defining-custom-function-types) section. The `authRef` property references a name of a defined workflow [auth definition](#Auth-Definition). It is used to provide authentication info to access the resource defined in the `operation` property and/or to invoke the function. The [`metadata`](#Workflow-Metadata) property allows users to define custom information to function definitions. This allows you for example to define functions that describe of a command executions on a Docker image: Function definitions themselves do not define data input parameters. Parameters can be defined via the `parameters` property in [function definitions](#FunctionRef-Definition) inside [actions](#Action-Definition). | resource | References an auth definition to be used to access the resource defined in the operation parameter | string | yes | | invocation | References an auth definition to be used to invoke the operation | string | no | The `authRef` property references a name of a defined workflow [auth definition](#Auth-Definition). It can be a string or an object. If it's a string, the referenced [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) is used solely for the function's invocation. If it's an object, it is possible to specify an [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) to use for the function's resource retrieval (as defined by the `operation` property) and another for its invocation. Example of a function definition configured to use an [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) called "My Basic Auth" upon invocation: Example of a function definition configured to use an [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) called "My Basic Auth" to retrieve the resource defined by the `operation` property, and an [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) called "My OIDC Auth" upon invocation: Note that if multiple functions share the same `operation` path (*which is the first component of the operation value, located before the first '#' character*), and if one of them defines an [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) for resource access, then it should always be used to access said resource. In other words, when retrieving the resource of the function "MySecuredFunction2" defined in the following example, the "My Api Key Auth" [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) should be used, because the "MySecuredFunction1" has defined it for resource access. This is done to avoid unnecessary repetitions of [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) configuration when using the same resource for multiple defined functions. It's worth noting that if an [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) has been defined for an OpenAPI function which's resource declare an authentication mechanism, the later should be used instead, thus ignoring entirely the [auth definition](#Auth-Definition). | name | Unique event name | string | yes | | source | CloudEvent source. If not set when `kind` is `produced`, runtimes are expected to use a default value, such as https://serverlessworkflow.io in order to comply with the [CloudEvent spec constraints](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/spec.md#source-1))| string | yes (if `type` is not defined. | | type | CloudEvent type | string | yes (if `source` is not defined) | | kind | Defines the event is either `consumed` or `produced` by the workflow. Default is `consumed` | enum | no | | [correlation](#Correlation-Definition) | Define event correlation rules for this event. Only used for consumed events | array | no | | dataOnly | If `true` (default value), only the Event payload is accessible to consuming Workflow states. If `false`, both event payload and context attributes should be accessible | boolean | no | Used to define events and their correlations. These events can be either consumed or produced during Workflow Execution as well as can be used to [trigger function/service invocations](#EventRef-Definition). The Serverless Workflow specification mandates that all events conform to the [CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec) specification. This is to assure consistency and portability of the events format used. The `name` property defines a single name of the event that is unique inside the workflow definition. This event name can be then referenced within [function](#Function-Definition) and [state](#Workflow-States) definitions. The `source` property matches this event definition with the [source](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md#source-1) property of the CloudEvent required attributes. The `type` property matches this event definition with the [type](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md#type) property of the CloudEvent required attributes. The `kind` property defines this event as either `consumed` or `produced`. In terms of the workflow, this means it is either an event that triggers workflow instance creation, or continuation of workflow instance execution (consumed), or an event that the workflow instance creates during its execution (produced). The default value (if not specified) of the `kind` property is `consumed`. Note that for `produced` event definitions, implementations must provide the value of the CloudEvent source attribute. In this case (i.e., when the `kind` property is set to `produced`), the `source` property of the event is not required in the workflow definition. Otherwise, (i.e., when the `kind` property is set to `consumed`), the `source` property must be defined in the event definition. Event correlation plays a big role in large event-driven applications. Correlating one or more events with a particular workflow instance can be done by defining the event correlation rules within the `correlation` property. This property is an array of [correlation](#Correlation-Definition) definitions. The CloudEvents specification allows users to add [Extension Context Attributes](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md#extension-context-attributes) and the correlation definitions can use these attributes to define clear matching event correlation rules. Extension context attributes are not part of the event payload, so they are serialized the same way as other standard required attributes. This means that the event payload does not have to be inspected by implementations in order to read and evaluate the defined correlation rules. Let's take a look at an example. Here we have two events that have an extension context attribute called "patientId" (as well as "department", which will be used in further examples below): We can then define a correlation rule, through which all consumed events with the "hospitalMonitorSystem", and the "com.hospital.patient.heartRateMonitor" type that have the **same** value of the `patientId` property to be correlated to the created workflow instance: If a workflow instance is created (e.g., via Event state) by consuming a "HeartRateReadingEvent" event, all other consumed events from the defined source and with the defined type that have the same "patientId" as the event that triggered the workflow instance should then also be associated with the same instance. You can also correlate multiple events together. In the following example, we assume that the workflow consumes two different event types, and we want to make sure that both are correlated, as in the above example, with the same "patientId": Event correlation can be based on equality (values of the defined "contextAttributeName" must be equal), but it can also be based on comparing it to custom defined values (string, or expression). For example: In this example, we have two correlation rules defined: The first one is on the "patientId" CloudEvent context attribute, meaning again that all consumed events from this source and type must have the same "patientId" to be considered. The second rule says that these events must all have a context attribute named "department" with the value of "UrgentCare". This allows developers to write orchestration workflows that are specifically targeted to patients that are in the hospital urgent care unit, for example. The `dataOnly` property deals with what Event data is accessible by the consuming Workflow states. If its value is `true` (default value), only the Event payload is accessible to consuming Workflow states. If `false`, both Event payload and context attributes should be accessible. Auth definitions can be used to define authentication information that should be applied to [function definitions](#Function-Definition). It can be used for both the retrieval of the function's resource (as defined by the `operation` property) and for the function's invocation. | name | Unique auth definition name | string | yes | | scheme | Auth scheme, can be "basic", "bearer", or "oauth2". Default is "basic" | enum | no | | properties | Auth scheme properties. Can be one of ["Basic properties definition"](#basic-properties-definition), ["Bearer properties definition"](#bearer-properties-definition), or ["OAuth2 properties definition"](#oauth2-properties-definition) | object | yes | The `name` property defines the unique auth definition name. The `scheme` property defines the auth scheme to be used. Can be "bearer", "basic" or "oauth2". The `properties` property defines the auth scheme properties information. Can be one of ["Basic properties definition"](#basic-properties-definition), ["Bearer properties definition"](#bearer-properties-definition), or ["OAuth2 properties definition"](#oauth2-properties-definition) See [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication#basic_authentication_scheme) for more information about Basic Authentication scheme. The Basic properties definition can have two types, either `string` or `object`. If `string` type, it defines a [workflow expression](#workflow-expressions) that contains all needed Basic auth information. If `object` type, it has the following properties: | username | String or a workflow expression. Contains the user name | string | yes | | password | String or a workflow expression. Contains the user password | string | yes | See [here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) for more information about Bearer Authentication scheme. | token | String or a workflow expression. Contains the token information | string | yes | See [here](https://oauth.net/2/) for more information about OAuth2 Authentication scheme. | authority | String or a workflow expression. Contains the authority information | string | no | | grantType | Defines the grant type. Can be "password", "clientCredentials", or "tokenExchange" | enum | yes | | clientId | String or a workflow expression. Contains the client identifier | string | yes | | clientSecret | Workflow secret or a workflow expression. Contains the client secret | string | no | | scopes | Array containing strings or workflow expressions. Contains the OAuth2 scopes | array | no | | username | String or a workflow expression. Contains the user name. Used only if grantType is 'resourceOwner' | string | no | | password | String or a workflow expression. Contains the user password. Used only if grantType is 'resourceOwner' | string | no | | audiences | Array containing strings or workflow expressions. Contains the OAuth2 audiences | array | no | | subjectToken | String or a workflow expression. Contains the subject token | string | no | | requestedSubject | String or a workflow expression. Contains the requested subject | string | no | | requestedIssuer | String or a workflow expression. Contains the requested issuer | string | no | | contextAttributeName | CloudEvent Extension Context Attribute name | string | yes | | contextAttributeValue | CloudEvent Extension Context Attribute value | string | no | Used to define event correlation rules. Only usable for `consumed` event definitions. The `contextAttributeName` property defines the name of the CloudEvent [extension context attribute](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md#extension-context-attributes). The `contextAttributeValue` property defines the value of the defined CloudEvent [extension context attribute](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md#extension-context-attributes). | eventRefs | References one or more unique event names in the defined workflow [events](#Event-Definition) | array | yes | | actionMode | Specifies how actions are to be performed (in sequence or in parallel). Default is `sequential` | enum | no | | [actions](#Action-Definition) | Actions to be performed | array | no | | [eventDataFilter](#Event-data-filters) | Event data filter definition | object | no | OnEvent definition allow you to define which [actions](#Action-Definition) are to be performed for the one or more [events definitions](#Event-Definition) defined in the `eventRefs` array. Note that the values of `eventRefs` array must be unique. The `actionMode` property defines if the defined actions need to be performed sequentially or in parallel. The `actions` property defines a list of actions to be performed. When specifying the `onEvents` definition it is important to consider the Event states `exclusive` property, because it determines how 'onEvents' is interpreted. Let's look at the following JSON definition of 'onEvents' to show this: "onEvents": [{ "eventRefs": ["HighBodyTemperature", "HighBloodPressure"], "actions": [{ "functionRef": { "refName": "SendTylenolOrder", "arguments": { "patient": "${ .patientId }" } } }, { "refName": "CallNurse", } ] }] Depending on the value of the Event states `exclusive` property, this definition can mean two different things: 1. If `exclusive` is set to `true`, the consumption of **either** the `HighBodyTemperature` or `HighBloodPressure` events will trigger action execution. 2. If `exclusive` is set to `false`, the consumption of **both** the `HighBodyTemperature` and `HighBloodPressure` events will trigger action execution. <img src="media/spec/event-state-onevents-example.png" height="300px" alt="Event onEvents example"/> | name | Unique Action name | string | no | | [functionRef](#FunctionRef-Definition) | References a reusable function definition | object or string | yes (if `eventRef` & `subFlowRef` are not defined) | | [eventRef](#EventRef-Definition) | References a `produce` and `consume` reusable event definitions | object | yes (if `functionRef` & `subFlowRef` are not defined) | | [subFlowRef](#SubFlowRef-Definition) | References a workflow to be invoked | object or string | yes (if `eventRef` & `functionRef` are not defined) | | [retryRef](#retry-definition) | References a defined workflow retry definition. If not defined uses the default runtime retry definition | string | no | | nonRetryableErrors | List of references to defined [workflow errors](#Defining-Errors) for which the action should not be retried. Used only when `autoRetries` is set to `true` | array | no | | retryableErrors | List of references to defined [workflow errors](#Defining-Errors) for which the action should be retried. Used only when `autoRetries` is set to `false` | array | no | | [actionDataFilter](#Action-data-filters) | Action data filter definition | object | no | | sleep | Defines time periods Workflow Execution should sleep before / after function execution | object | no | | [condition](#Workflow-Expressions) | Expression, if defined, must evaluate to `true` for this action to be performed. If `false`, action is disregarded | string | no | Actions specify invocations of services or other workflows during Workflow Execution. Service invocation can be done in three different ways: * Reference [functions definitions](#Function-Definition) by its unique name using the `functionRef` property. * Reference a `produced` and `consumed` [event definitions](#Event-Definition) via the `eventRef` property. * Reference a sub-workflow invocation via the `subFlowRef` property. Note that `functionRef`, `eventRef`, and `subFlowRef` are mutually exclusive, meaning that only one of them can be specified in a single action definition. The `name` property specifies the action name. In the event-based scenario a service, or a set of services we want to invoke are not exposed via a specific resource URI for example, but can only be invoked via an event. The [eventRef](#EventRef-Definition) property defines the referenced `produced` event via its `produceEventRef` property and a `consumed` event via its `consumeEventRef` property. The `sleep` property can be used to define time periods that Workflow Execution should sleep before and/or after function execution. It can have two properties: * `before` - defines the amount of time (ISO 8601 duration format) to sleep before function invocation. * `after` - defines the amount of time (ISO 8601 duration format) to sleep after function invocation. Function invocation timeouts should be handled via the states [timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) definition. The `retryRef` property references one of the defined workflow retries by it's unique name. If not set, the action should be retried according to the default retry policy of the runtime implementation. For more information about workflow retries reference [this section](#retry-definition). The `nonRetryableErrors` property is a list that references one or more unique names of workflow error definitions. This is the list of known errors for which the action should not be retried for. It should be used only when the workflow top-level `autoRetries` property is set to `true`. The `retryableErrors` property is a list that references one or more unique names of workflow error definitions. This is the list of known errors for which the action should be retried for. It should be used only when the workflow top-level `autoRetries` property is set to `false`. The `condition` property is a [workflow expression](#Workflow-Expressions). If defined, it must evaluate to `true` for this action to be performed. If it evaluates to `false` the action is skipped. If the `condition` property is not defined, the action is always performed. Often you want to group your workflows into small logical units that solve a particular business problem and can be reused in multiple other workflow definitions. <img src="media/spec/subflowstateref.png" height="350px" alt="Referencing reusable workflow via SubFlow actions"/> Reusable workflows are referenced by their `id` property via the SubFlow action `workflowId` parameter. For the simple case, `subFlowRef` can be a string containing the `id` of the sub-workflow to invoke. If you want to specify other parameters then a [subFlowRef](#SubFlowRef-Definition) should be provided instead. Referenced sub-workflows must declare their own [function](#Function-Definition) and [event](#Event-Definition) definitions. `FunctionRef` definition can have two types, either `string` or `object`. If `string` type, it defines the name of the referenced [function](#Function-Definition). This can be used as a short-cut definition when you don't need to define any other parameters, for example: Note that if used with `string` type, the invocation of the function is synchronous. If you need to define parameters in your `functionRef` definition, you can define it with its `object` type which has the following properties: | refName | Name of the referenced [function](#Function-Definition) | string | yes | | arguments | Arguments (inputs) to be passed to the referenced function | object | yes (if function type is `graphql`, otherwise no) | | selectionSet | Used if function type is `graphql`. String containing a valid GraphQL [selection set](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Selection-Sets) | string | yes (if function type is `graphql`, otherwise no) | | invoke | Specifies if the function should be invoked `sync` or `async`. Default is `sync` | enum | no | The `refName` property is the name of the referenced [function](#Function-Definition). The `arguments` property defines the arguments that are to be passed to the referenced function. Here is an example of using the `arguments` property: The `invoke` property defines how the function is invoked (sync or async). Default value of this property is `sync`, meaning that Workflow Execution should wait until the function completes. If set to `async`, Workflow Execution should just invoke the function and should not wait until its completion. Note that in this case the action does not produce any results and the associated actions actionDataFilter as well as its retry definition, if defined, should be ignored. In addition, functions that are invoked async do not propagate their errors to the associated action definition and the workflow state, meaning that any errors that happen during their execution cannot be handled in the workflow states onErrors definition. Note that errors raised during functions that are invoked async should not fail Workflow Execution. Allows defining invocation of a function via event. | [produceEventRef](#Event-Definition) | Reference to the unique name of a `produced` event definition | string | yes | | [consumeEventRef](#Event-Definition) | Reference to the unique name of a `consumed` event definition | string | no | | consumeEventTimeout | Maximum amount of time (ISO 8601 format) to wait for the consume event. If not defined it be set to the [actionExecutionTimeout](#Workflow-Timeout-Definition) | string | no | | data | If string type, an expression which selects parts of the states data output to become the data (payload) of the event referenced by `produceEventRef`. If object type, a custom object to become the data (payload) of the event referenced by `produceEventRef`. | string or object | no | | contextAttributes | Add additional event extension context attributes to the trigger/produced event | object | no | | invoke | Specifies if the function should be invoked sync or async. Default is sync | enum | no | References a `produced` and `consumed` [event definitions](#Event-Definition) via the `produceEventRef` and `consumeEventRef` properties, respectively. The `data` property can have two types: string or object. If it is of string type, it is an expression that can select parts of state data to be used as payload of the event referenced by `produceEventRef`. If it is of object type, you can define a custom object to be the event payload. The `contextAttributes` property allows you to add one or more [extension context attributes](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md#extension-context-attributes) to the trigger/produced event. The `consumeEventTimeout` property defines the maximum amount of time (ISO 8601 format) to wait for the result event. If not defined it should default to the [actionExecutionTimeout](#Workflow-Timeout-Definition). If the event defined by the `consumeEventRef` property is not received in that set time, action invocation should raise an error that can be handled in the states `onErrors` definition. In case the `consumeEventRef` is not defined, the `consumeEventTimeout` property is ignored. `sync`, meaning that Workflow Execution should wait until the function completes (the result event is received). If set to `async`, Workflow Execution should just produce the trigger event and should not wait for the result event. Note that in this case the action does not produce any results (payload of the result event) and the associated actions eventDataFilter as well as Functions that are invoked via events (sync or async) do not propagate their errors to the associated action definition and the workflow state, meaning that any errors that happen during their execution cannot be handled in the workflow states onErrors definition. Note that errors raised during functions that are invoked sync or async in this case should not fail Workflow Execution. `SubFlowRef` definition can have two types, namely `string` or `object`. If `string` type, it defines the unique id of the sub-workflow to be invoked. This short-hand definition can be used if sub-workflow lookup is done only by its `id` property and not its `version` property. If you need to define the `version` properties, you can use its `object` type: | workflowId | Sub-workflow unique id | string | yes | | version | Sub-workflow version | string | no | | invoke | Specifies if the subflow should be invoked `sync` or `async`. Default is `sync` | enum | no | | onParentComplete | If `invoke` is `async`, specifies if subflow execution should `terminate` or `continue` when parent workflow completes. Default is `terminate` | enum | no | The `workflowId` property define the unique ID of the sub-workflow to be invoked. Usually, the workflow id should not be the same id of the workflow where the action is defined. Otherwise, it may occur undesired recurring calls to the same workflow. The `version` property defined the unique version of the sub-workflow to be invoked. If this property is defined, runtimes should match both the `id` and the `version` properties defined in the sub-workflow definition. The `invoke` property defines how the subflow is invoked (sync or async). Default value of this property is `sync`, meaning that Workflow Execution should wait until the subflow completes. If set to `async`, Workflow Execution should just invoke the subflow and not wait for its results. Note that in this case the action does not produce any results, and the associated actions actionDataFilter as well as Subflows that are invoked async do not propagate their errors to the associated action definition and the onErrors definition. Note that errors raised during subflows that are invoked async The `onParentComplete` property defines how subflow execution that is invoked async should behave if the parent workflow completes execution before the subflow completes its own execution. The default value of this property is `terminate`, meaning that if the parent workflow (the workflow that invoked the subflow) completes, execution of the subflow should be terminated. If it is set to `continue`, if the parent workflow completes, the subflow execution is allowed to continue its own execution. | errorRef or errorRefs | Reference one unique workflow error definition, or multiple unique workflow error definitions | string (errorRef) or array (errorRefs) | yes | | [transition](#Transitions) | Transition to next state to handle the error | string or object | yes (if `end` is not defined) | | [end](#End-Definition) | End Workflow Execution if this error is encountered | boolean or object | yes (if `transition` is not defined) | The `errorRef` property references the unique workflow error definition. For more info on workflow error handling referece [this section](#Defining-Errors). The `errorRefs`property references at least one of the defined workflow error definitions. Can be used when `errorRef` is not used. Usable when you want to define multiple error refs for which the same transition or end definition should be applied.For more info on workflow error handling Note that the `errorRef` and `errorRefs` properties are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can only specify one or the other, but not both at the same time. The `transition` property defines the transition to the next workflow state in cases when the defined error happens during runtime execution. If `transition` is not defined you can also define the `end` property which will end Workflow Execution at that point. Note that the `transition` and `end` properties are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can only specify one or the other, For more information, see the [Workflow Error Handling](#Workflow-Error-Handling) sections. | name | Unique retry strategy name | string | yes | | delay | Time delay between retry attempts (ISO 8601 duration format) | string | no | | maxAttempts | Maximum number of retry attempts. Value of 1 means no retries are performed | string or number | yes | | maxDelay | Maximum amount of delay between retry attempts (ISO 8601 duration format) | string | no | | increment | Static duration which will be added to the delay between successive retries (ISO 8601 duration format) | string | no | | multiplier | Float value by which the delay is multiplied before each attempt. For example: "1.2" meaning that each successive delay is 20% longer than the previous delay. For example, if delay is 'PT10S', then the delay between the first and second attempts will be 10 seconds, and the delay before the third attempt will be 12 seconds. | float or string | no | | jitter | If float type, maximum amount of random time added or subtracted from the delay between each retry relative to total delay (between 0.0 and 1.0). If string type, absolute maximum amount of random time added or subtracted from the delay between each retry (ISO 8601 duration format) | float or string | no | Defines the states retry policy (strategy). This is an explicit definition and can be reused across multiple defined state [actions](#Action-Definition). The `name` property specifies the unique name of the retry definition (strategy). This unique name can be referred by workflow states [error definitions](#Error-Definition). The `delay` property specifies the initial time delay between retry attempts (ISO 8601 duration format). The `increment` property specifies a static duration which will be added to the delay between successive retries. which means that we will retry up to 4 times after waiting with increasing delay between attempts; in this example 10, 12, 14, and 16 seconds between retries. The `multiplier` property specifies the value by which the interval time is increased for each of the retry attempts. in this example 10, 20, 40, and 80 seconds between retries. If both `increment` and `multiplier` properties are defined, `increment` should be applied first and then the `multiplier` when determining the next retry time. The `maxAttempts` property determines the maximum number of retry attempts allowed and is a positive integer value. The `jitter` property is important to prevent certain scenarios where clients are retrying in sync, possibly causing or contributing to a transient failure precisely because they're retrying at the same time. Adding a typically small, bounded random amount of time to the period between retries serves the purpose of attempting to prevent these retries from happening simultaneously, possibly reducing total time to complete requests and overall congestion. How this value is used in the exponential backoff algorithm is left up to implementations. `jitter` may be specified as a percentage relative to the total delay. Once the next retry attempt delay is calculated, we can apply `jitter` as a percentage value relative to this calculated delay. For example, if your calculated delay for the next retry is six seconds, and we specify a `jitter` value of 0.3, a random amount of time between 0 and 1.8 (0.3 times 6) is to be added or subtracted from the calculated delay. Alternatively, `jitter` may be defined as an absolute value specified as an ISO 8601 duration. This way, the maximum amount of random time added is fixed and will not increase as new attempts are made. The `maxDelay` property determines the maximum amount of delay that is desired between retry attempts, and is applied after `increment`, `multiplier`, and `jitter`. in this example we might observe the following series of delays: * 11s (min(`maxDelay`, (`delay` +/- rand(`jitter`)) => min(100, 10 + 1)) * 43s (min(`maxDelay`, (11s * `multiplier`) +/- rand(`jitter`)) => min(100, (11 * 4) - 1)) * 100s (min(`maxDelay`, (43s * `multiplier`) +/- rand(`jitter`)) => min(100, (43 * 4) + 0)) * 100s (min(`maxDelay`, (100s * `multiplier`) +/- rand(`jitter`)) => min(100, (100 * 4) - 1)) `Transition` definition can have two types, either `string` or `object`. If `string`, it defines the name of the state to transition to. If you need to define additional parameters in your `transition` definition, you can define | [nextState](#Transitions) | Name of the state to transition to next | string | yes | | [compensate](#Workflow-Compensation) | If set to `true`, triggers workflow compensation before this transition is taken. Default is `false` | boolean | no | | produceEvents | Array of [producedEvent](#ProducedEvent-Definition) definitions. Events to be produced before the transition takes place | array | no | The `nextState` property defines the name of the state to transition to next. The `compensate` property allows you to trigger [compensation](#Workflow-Compensation) before the transition (if set to `true`). The `produceEvents` property allows you to define a list of events to produce before the transition happens. Transitions allow you to move from one state (control-logic block) to another. For more information see the [Transitions section](#Transitions) section. | name | Data condition name | string | no | | [condition](#Workflow-Expressions) | Workflow expression evaluated against state data. Must evaluate to `true` or `false` | string | yes | | [transition](#Transitions) | Transition to another state if condition is `true` | string or object | yes (if `end` is not defined) | | [end](#End-Definition) | End Workflow Execution if condition is `true` | boolean or object | yes (if `transition` is not defined) | Switch state data conditions specify a data-based condition statement, which causes a transition to another workflow state if evaluated to `true`. The `condition` property of the condition defines an expression (e.g., `${ .applicant | .age > 18 }`), which selects parts of the state data input. The condition must evaluate to `true` or `false`. If the condition is evaluated to `true`, you can specify either the `transition` or `end` definitions to decide what to do, transition to another workflow state, or end Workflow Execution. Note that `transition` and `end` definitions are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can specify either one or the other, but not both. | name | Event condition name | string | no | | eventRef | References an unique event name in the defined workflow events | string | yes | Switch state event conditions specify events, which the switch state must wait for. Each condition can reference one workflow-defined event. Upon arrival of this event, the associated transition is taken. The `eventRef` property references a name of one of the defined workflow events. If the referenced event is received, you can specify either the `transition` or `end` definitions to decide what to do, transition to another workflow state, or end Workflow Execution. The `eventDataFilter` property can be used to filter event data when it is received. Note that `transition` and `end` | name | Branch name | string | yes | | [actions](#Action-Definition) | Actions to be executed in this branch | array | yes | | [timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) | Branch specific timeout settings | object | no | A branch can define actions that need to be executed. For the [`SubFlowRef`](#SubFlowRef-Definition) action, the workflow id should not be the same id of the workflow where the branch is defined. Otherwise, it may occur undesired recurring calls to the same workflow. The `timeouts` property can be used to set branch specific timeout settings. Parallel state branches can set the `actionExecTimeout` and `branchExecTimeout` timeout properties. For more information on workflow timeouts reference the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section. By default, exceptions that are not handled within branches stop branch execution and are propagated to the Parallel state and should be handled with its `onErrors` definition. If the parallel states branch defines actions, all exceptions that arise from executing these actions (after all allotted retries are exhausted) are propagated to the parallel state and can be handled with the parallel states `onErrors` definition. If the parallel states defines a subflow action, exceptions that occur during execution of the called workflow can choose to handle exceptions on their own. All unhandled exceptions from the called workflow execution however are propagated back to the parallel state and can be handled with the parallel states `onErrors` definition. Note that once an error that is propagated to the parallel state from a branch and handled by the states `onErrors` definition is handled (its associated transition is taken) no further errors from branches of this parallel state should be considered as the workflow control flow logic has already moved to a different state. Can be either `string` or `object` type. If type string, it defines the name of the workflow starting state. In this case it's assumed that the `schedule` property is not defined. If the start definition is of type `object`, it has the following structure: | stateName | Name of the starting workflow state | string | no | | [schedule](#Schedule-Definition) | Define the recurring time intervals or cron expressions at which workflow instances should be automatically started. | string or object | yes | The start definition can be either `string` or `object` type. If `string` type, it defines the name of the workflow starting state. If `object` type, it provides the ability to set the workflow starting state name, as well as the `schedule` property. The `stateName` property can be set to define the starting workflow state. If not specified, the first state in the [workflow states definition](#Workflow-States) should be used as the starting workflow state. The `schedule` property allows to define scheduled workflow instance creation. Scheduled starts have two different choices. You can define a recurring time interval or cron-based schedule at which a workflow instance **should** be created (automatically). You can also define cron-based scheduled starts, which allows you to specify periodically started workflow instances based on a [cron](http://crontab.org/) definition. Cron-based scheduled starts can handle absolute time intervals (i.e., not calculated in respect to some particular point in time). One use case for cron-based scheduled starts is a workflow that performs periodical data batch processing. In this case we could use a cron definition ``` text [See here](http://crontab.org/) to get more information on defining cron expressions. One thing to discuss when dealing with cron-based scheduled starts is when the workflow starting state is an [Event](#Event-State). Event states define that workflow instances are triggered by the existence of the defined event(s). Defining a cron-based scheduled starts for the runtime implementations would mean that there needs to be an event service that issues the needed events at the defined times to trigger workflow instance creation. Defining a start definition is not required. If it's not defined, the starting workflow state has to be the very first state defined in the [workflow states array](#Workflow-States). `Schedule` definition can have two types, either `string` or `object`. If `string` type, it defines time interval describing when the workflow instance should be automatically created. If you need to define the `cron` or the `timezone` parameters in your `schedule` definition, you can define | interval | A recurring time interval expressed in the derivative of ISO 8601 format specified below. Declares that workflow instances should be automatically created at the start of each time interval in the series. | string | yes (if `cron` is not defined) | | [cron](#Cron-Definition) | Cron expression defining when workflow instances should be automatically created | object | yes (if `interval` is not defined) | | timezone | Timezone name used to evaluate the interval & cron-expression. If the interval specifies a date-time w/ timezone then proper timezone conversion will be applied. (default: UTC). | string | no | The `interval` property uses a derivative of ISO 8601 recurring time interval format to describe a series of consecutive time intervals for workflow instances to be automatically created at the start of. Unlike full ISO 8601, this derivative format does not allow expression of an explicit number of recurrences or identification of a series by the date and time at the start and end of its first time interval. There are three ways to express a recurring interval: 1. `R/<Start>/<Duration>`: Defines the start time and a duration, for example: "R/2020-03-20T13:00:00Z/PT2H", meaning workflow instances will be automatically created every 2 hours starting from March 20th 2020 at 1pm UTC. 2. `R/<Duration>/<End>`: Defines a duration and an end, for example: "R/PT2H/2020-05-11T15:30:00Z", meaning that workflow instances will be automatically created every 2 hours until until May 11th 2020 at 3:30pm UTC (i.e., the last instance will be created 2 hours prior to that, at 1:30pm UTC). 3. `R/<Duration>`: Defines a duration only, for example: "R/PT2H", meaning workflow instances will be automatically created every 2 hours. The start time of the first interval may be indeterminate, but should be delayed by no more than the specified duration and must repeat on schedule after that (this is effectively supplying the start time "out-of-band" as permitted ISO ISO 8601-1:2019 section 5.6.1 NOTE 1). Each runtime implementation should document how the start time for a duration-only interval is established. The `cron` property uses a [cron expression](http://crontab.org/) to describe a repeating interval upon which a workflow instance should be created automatically. For more information see the [cron definition](#Cron-Definition) section. The `timezone` property is used to define a time zone name to evaluate the cron or interval expression against. If not specified, it should default to UTC time zone. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) for a list of timezone names. For ISO 8601 date time values in `interval` or `cron.validUntil`, runtimes should treat `timezone` as the 'local time' (UTC if `timezone` is not defined by the user). Note that when the workflow starting state is an [Event](#Event-State) defining cron-based scheduled starts for the runtime implementations would mean that there needs to be an event service that issues `Cron` definition can have two types, either `string` or `object`. If `string` type, it defines the cron expression describing when the workflow instance should be created (automatically). If you need to define the `validUntil` parameters in your `cron` definition, you can define | expression | Cron expression describing when the workflow instance should be created (automatically) | string | yes | | validUntil | Specific date and time (ISO 8601 format) when the cron expression is no longer valid | string | no | The `expression` property is a a [cron expression](http://crontab.org/) which defines when workflow instances should be created (automatically). The `validUntil` property defines a date and time (using ISO 8601 format). When the `validUntil` time is reached, the cron expression for instances creations of this workflow should no longer be valid. This tells the runtime engine to create an instance of this workflow every hour at minutes 15, 30 and 45. This is to be done until November 5, 2021, 8:15:30 am, US Eastern Standard Time as defined by the `validUntil` property value. Can be either `boolean` or `object` type. If type boolean, must be set to `true`, for example: In this case it's assumed that the `terminate` property has its default value of `false`, and the `produceEvents`, `compensate`, and `continueAs` properties are not defined. If the end definition is of type `object`, it has the following structure: | terminate | If `true`. terminates workflow instance execution | boolean | no | | produceEvents | Array of [producedEvent](#ProducedEvent-Definition) definitions. Defines events that should be produced. | array | no | | [compensate](#Workflow-Compensation) | If set to `true`, triggers workflow compensation before Workflow Execution completes. Default is `false` | boolean | no | | [continueAs](#continuing-as-a-new-execution) | Defines that current Workflow Execution should stop, and execution should continue as a new workflow instance of the provided id | string or object | no | End definitions are used to explicitly define execution completion of a workflow instance or Workflow Execution path. A workflow definition must include at least one [workflow state](#Workflow-States). Note that [Switch states](#Switch-State) cannot declare to be workflow end states. Their conditions however can define a stop of Workflow Execution. The `terminate` property, if set to `true`, completes the workflow instance execution, this any other active execution paths. If a terminate end is reached inside a ForEach or Parallel state the entire workflow instance is terminated. The [`produceEvents`](#ProducedEvent-Definition) allows defining events which should be produced by the workflow instance before workflow stops its execution. It's important to mention that if the workflow `keepActive` property is set to`true`, the only way to complete execution of the workflow instance is if Workflow Execution reaches a state that defines an end definition with `terminate` property set to `true`, or, if the [`workflowExecTimeout`](#Workflow-Timeouts) property is defined, the time defined in its `interval` is reached. The [compensate](#Workflow-Compensation) property defines that workflow compensation should be performed before the workflow execution is completed. The [continueAs](#Continuing-as-a-new-Execution) property defines that the current workflow instance should stop its execution, and worklow execution should continue as a new instance of a new workflow. When defined, it should be assumed that `terminate` is `true`. If `continueAs` is defined, and `terminate` is explicitly set to `false`, runtimes should report this to users. Producing events, and compensation should still be performed (if defined) before the Workflow Execution is stopped, and continued as a new workflow instance with the defined workflow id. | eventRef | Reference to a defined unique event name in the [events](#Event-Definition) definition | string | yes | | data | If string type, an expression which selects parts of the states data output to become the data (payload) of the produced event. If object type, a custom object to become the data (payload) of produced event. | string or object | no | | contextAttributes | Add additional event extension context attributes | object | no | Defines the event (CloudEvent format) to be produced when Workflow Execution completes or during a workflow [transitions](#Transitions). The `eventRef` property must match the name of one of the defined `produced` events in the [events](#Event-Definition) definition. The `data` property can have two types, object or string. If of string type, it is an expression that can select parts of state data to be used as the event payload. If of object type, you can define a custom object to be the event payload. to the generated event. Being able to produce events when Workflow Execution completes or during state transition allows for event-based orchestration communication. For example, completion of an orchestration workflow can notify other orchestration workflows to decide if they need to act upon the produced event, or notify monitoring services of the current state of Workflow Execution, etc. It can be used to create very dynamic orchestration scenarios. Serverless workflow states can have one or more incoming and outgoing transitions (from/to other states). Each state can define a `transition` definition that is used to determine which state to transition to next. Implementers **must** use the unique State `name` property for determining the transition. Events can be produced during state transitions. The `produceEvents` property of the `transition` definitions allows you to reference one or more defined `produced` events in the workflow [events definitions](#Event-Definition). For each of the produced events you can select what parts of state data to be the event payload. Transitions can trigger compensation via their `compensate` property. See the [Workflow Compensation](#Workflow-Compensation) section for more information. Specifying additional properties, namely properties which are not defined by the specification are only allowed in the [Workflow Definition](#Workflow-Definition-Structure). Additional properties serve the same purpose as [Workflow Metadata](#Workflow-Metadata). They allow you to enrich the workflow definition with custom information. Additional properties, just like workflow metadata, should not affect Workflow Execution. Implementations may choose to use additional properties or ignore them. In this example, we specify the `loglevel`, `environment`, and `category` additional properties. Serverless Workflow language allows you to define `explicit` error handling, meaning you can define what should happen in case of errors inside your workflow model rather than some generic error handling entity. This allows error handling to become part of your orchestration activities and as such part of your business problem solutions. The idea behind the way Serverless Workflow defines error handling is that workflows should only fail due to unknown bugs during execution. In general, you should always write your workflows so that they do not fail on any known failures. Each workflow state can define error handling, which is related only to errors that may arise during its execution. Error handling defined in one state cannot be used to handle errors that happened during execution of another state during Workflow Execution. Unknown errors that may arise during workflow state execution that are not explicitly handled within the workflow definition should be reported by runtime implementations and halt Workflow Execution. Within workflow definitions, errors defined are `domain specific`, meaning they are defined within the actual business domain, rather than their technical (programming-language-specific) description. For example, we can define errors such as "Order not found", or "Item not in inventory", rather than having to use terms such as "java.lang.IllegalAccessError", or "response.status == 404", which might make little to no sense to our specific problem domain, as well as may not be portable across various runtime implementations. In addition to the domain specific error name, users have the option to also add an optional error code to help runtime implementations with mapping defined errors to concrete underlying technical ones. Runtime implementations must be able to map the error domain specific name (and the optional error code) to concrete technical errors that arise during Workflow Execution. Known workflow errors, that we know we need to handle during Workflow Execution should be defined in the workflow top-level 'errors' property. This property can be either a string type, meaning it can reference a reusable JSON or Yaml definition file including the error definitions, or it can have an array type where you can define these checked errors in-line in your workflow definition. 1. Referencing a reusable JSON/Yaml error definition file: 2. Defining workflow errors in-line: These defined errors can then be referenced by their unique name in both states `onErrors` definitions as well as in actions `nonRetryableErrors` and `retryableErrors` properties. Retries allow workflows to deal with intermittent failures of services they are trying to invoke. In addition, retries allow workflows to continue (not fail) execution and allow us to fix possible errors with invoked services and continue execution after they are fixed. Retries are important for both short-lived and long-lived workflows, as well as in both stateless and stateful scenarios. 1. Retrying on specified known (checked) errors. 2. Automatic retrying on both known (checked) and not-known (unchecked) errors. Which retry option the workflow should use by default is defined via the workflow top-level `autoRetries` property. By default, the value of the `autoRetries` is set to `false`, meaning that retry option 1) is used by default. You can enable automatic retrying (option 2) by setting `autoRetries` to `true`. Regardless of the chosen retries option, note that workflows in general should be designed to not fail. Workflows should be able to recover from intermittent failures. This is the default option when the workflow top-level `autoRetries` property is not specified or is set to `false`. This retry options is suited for stateless / short-running workflows where retries should be performed when specifically wanted. Note that in this scenario when unknown (unchecked) errors happen during action execution (service invocation), Workflow Execution should fail. Let's take a look at an example. To start, let's define a workflow top-level `retries` definition: Our `retries` definitions can be referenced by actions. For example: Each action can define the retry strategy it wants to use. If it does not define one, the action is in this case not retries. Actions can define a list of known errors in its `retryableErrors` array. If defined, then the action should be retried for those errors according to the referenced retry strategy. In our example, "MyFirstFunction" invocation should be retried according to the "FirstRetryStrategy" policy only on known errors "SomeErrorOne" and "SomeErrorTwo". If for a known error (defined in `retryableErrors`) the retry limit is reached and the error still persist, it can be handled in the states `onErrors` definition. If an unknown (unchecked) error happens during action execution, and this error is also not handled in the states `onErrors` definition, the This is the option used when the workflow top-level `autoRetries` property is set to `true`. Automatic retries are well suited to long-running and stateful workflow orchestrations. It allows workflows to recover from failures thus providing more resilience. There is a possible cost associated with automatic retries in terms of resource and computing power utilization. With this retries option, action executions should be retried automatically for both known (checked) as well as unknown (unchecked) errors. This means that you do not have to define a retry strategy for actions for them to have retried, it's included by default. Users can still define a custom retry strategy for each action via the `retryRef` property. If a retry strategy is not defined, a default retry strategy should be used. Runtime implementations can define their own default retry strategy. Serverless Workflow recommends the following settings: * `maxAttempts` to be `unlimited`, meaning that the action should be retried indefinitely until successful. * `delay` to be set to one second, meaning that there is a one second delay between action retries. * `multiplier` to be set to two meaning that the delay should be multiplied by two for each retry attempt. Runtimes should document their default retry strategy to users, so it's clear which property values they are using for the default. Actions can define for which known (checked) errors they should not be retried for. This is done via the actions `nonRetryableErrors` property. If a known error happens during action execution which is included in the `nonRetryableErrors` property array, that action should not be retried and the error then should be handled in the workflow states `onErrors` property. Let's take a look at an examples of defining retries when using the automatic retries option. This example assumes that the workfow top level `autoRetries` property is set to `true`. To start, let's define a workflow top-level `retries` definition: In our example the first action named `MyFirstFunction` is going to be retried according to the `FirstRetryStrategy` retry policy for all errors except `SomeErrorOne` and `SomeErrorTwo`. The seconds action named `MySecondFunction` is going to be retried according to the `SecondRetryStrategy` retry policy for all errors except `SomeErrorTwo` and `SomeErrorThree`. The third action named `MyThirdFunction` is going to retried according to the default runtime retry policy. It will be retried for all errors both known (checked) as well as unknown (unckecked). The fourth action named `MyFourthFunction` is going to be retried according to the `DoNotRetryStrategy` retry policy which has the `maxAttempts` property set to `1`, meaning that this action will not be retried. 1. Workflow execution 2. State execution 3. Action execution 4. Branch execution 5. Event consumption time The specification allows for timeouts to be defined on the top-level workflow definition, as well as in each of the workflow state definitions. Note that the timeout settings defined in states, and state branches overwrite the top-level workflow definition for state, action and branch execution. If they are not defined, then the top-level timeout settings should take in effect. This top-level workflow timeout setting defines that the maximum execution time of all defined workflow states is two seconds each. Now let's say that we have worfklow states "A" and "B". State "A" does not define a timeout definition, but state "B" does: Since state "A" does not overwrite the top-level `stateExecTimeout`, its execution timeout should be inherited from the top-level timeout definition. On the other hand, state "B" does define it's own `stateExecTimeout`, in which case it would overwrite the default setting, meaning that it would its execution time has a max limit of ten seconds. Defining timeouts is not mandatory, meaning that if not defined, all the timeout settings should be assumed to be "unlimited". Note that the defined Workflow Execution timeout has precedence over all other defined timeouts. Just to give an extreme example, let's say we define the Workflow Execution timeout to ten seconds, and the state execution timeout to twenty seconds. In this case if the Workflow Execution timeout is reached it should follow the rules of Workflow Execution timeout and end Workflow Execution, no matter what the state execution time has been set to. Workflow timeouts are defined with the top-level `timeouts` property. It can have two types, `string` and `object`. If `string` type it defines an URI that points to a Json or Yaml file containing the workflow timeout definitions. If `object` type, it is used to define the timeout definitions in-line and has the following properties: | [workflowExecTimeout](#workflowexectimeout-definition) | Workflow execution timeout (ISO 8601 duration format) | string or object | no | | [stateExecTimeout](#states-timeout-definition) | Workflow state execution timeout (ISO 8601 duration format) | string | no | | actionExecTimeout | Actions execution timeout (ISO 8601 duration format) | string | no | | [branchExecTimeout](#branch-timeout-definition) | Branch execution timeout (ISO 8601 duration format) | string | no | | [eventTimeout](#event-timeout-definition) | Default timeout for consuming defined events (ISO 8601 duration format) | string | no | The `eventTimeout` property defines the maximum amount of time to wait to consume defined events. If not specified it should default to "unlimited". The `branchExecTimeout` property defines the maximum execution time for a single branch. If not specified it should default to The `actionExecTimeout` property defines the maximum execution time for a single actions definition. If not specified it should default to "unlimited". Note that an action definition can include multiple actions. The `stateExecTimeout` property defines the maximum execution time for a single workflow state. If not specified it should default to The `workflowExecTimeout` property defines the Workflow Execution timeout. It is defined using the ISO 8601 duration format. If not defined, the Workflow Execution should be given "unlimited" amount of time to complete. `workflowExecTimeout` can have two possibly types, either `string` or `object`. If `string` type, it defines the maximum Workflow Execution time. If Object type it has the following format: | duration | Timeout duration (ISO 8601 duration format) | string | yes | | interrupt | If `false`, workflow instance is allowed to finish current execution. If `true`, current Workflow Execution is stopped immediately. Default is `false` | boolean | no | | runBefore | Name of a workflow state to be executed before workflow instance is terminated | string | no | The `duration` property defines the time duration of the execution timeout. Once a workflow instance is created, and the amount of the defined time is reached, the workflow instance should be terminated. The `interrupt` property defines if the currently running instance should be allowed to finish its current execution flow before it needs to be terminated. If set to `true`, the current instance execution should stop immediately. The `runBefore` property defines a name of a workflow state to be executed before workflow instance is terminated. States referenced by `runBefore` (as well as any other states that they transition to) must obey following rules: * They should not have any incoming transitions (should not be part of the main workflow control-flow logic) * They cannot be states marked for compensation (have their `usedForCompensation` property set to `true`) * If it is a single state, it must define an [end definition](#End-Definition), if it transitions to other states, at last one must define it. * They can transition only to states are also not part of the main control flow logic (and are not marked for compensation). Runtime implementations should raise compile time / parsing exceptions if any of the rules mentioned above are not obeyed in the workflow definition. All workflow states except Sleep and Inject States can define the `timeouts` property and can define different timeout settings depending on their state type. Please reference each [workflow state definitions](#Workflow-States) for more information on which timeout settings are available for each state type. Workflow states timeouts cannot define the `workflowExecTimeout` property. Workflow states can set their `stateExecTimeout` property inside the `timeouts` definition. The value of this property is a time duration (ISO 8601 duration format). It must be a duration that's greater than zero and defines the total state execution timeout. When this timeout is reached, state execution should be stopped and can be handled as a timeout error in the states `onErrors` definition. [Parallel states](#Parallel-State) can define the `branchExecTimeout` property. If defined on the state level, it applies to each [branch](#Parallel-State-Branch) of the Parallel state. Note that each parallel state branch can overwrite this setting to define its own branch execution timeout. If a branch does not define this timeout property, it should be inherited from it's state definition branch timeout setting. If its state does not define it either, it should be inherited from the top-level workflow branch timeout settings. The Event state `timeouts` property can be used to specify state specific timeout settings. For event state it can contain the `eventTimeout` property which is defined using the ISO 8601 data and time format. You can specify for example "PT15M" to represent 15 minutes or "P2DT3H4M" to represent 2 days, 3 hours and 4 minutes. `eventTimeout` values should always be represented as durations and not as specific time intervals. The `eventTimeout` property needs to be described in detail for Event states as it depends on whether or not the Event state is a workflow starting state or not. If the Event state is a workflow starting state, incoming events may trigger workflow instances. In this case, if the `exclusive` property is set to `true`, the `eventTimeout` property should be ignored. If the `exclusive` property is set to `false`, in this case, the defined `eventTimeout` represents the time between arrival of specified events. To give an example, consider the following: The first `eventTimeout` would start once any of the referenced events are consumed. If the second event does not occur within the defined eventTimeout, no workflow instance should be created. If the event state is not a workflow starting state, the `eventTimeout` property is relative to the time when the state becomes active. If the defined event conditions (regardless of the value of the exclusive property) are not satisfied within the defined timeout period, the event state should transition to the next state or end the workflow instance in case it is an end state without performing any actions. Compensation deals with undoing or reversing the work of one or more states which have already successfully completed. For example, let's say that we have charged a customer $100 for an item purchase. In the case customer laster on decides to cancel this purchase we need to undo it. One way of doing that is to credit the customer $100. It's important to understand that compensation with workflows is not the same as for example rolling back a transaction (a strict undo). Compensating a workflow state which has successfully completed might involve multiple logical steps and thus is part of the overall business logic that must be defined within the workflow itself. To explain this let's use our previous example and say that when our customer made the item purchase, our workflow has sent her/him a confirmation email. In the case, to compensate this purchase, we cannot just "undo" the confirmation email sent. Instead, we want to send a second email to the customer which includes purchase cancellation information. Compensation in Serverless Workflow must be explicitly defined by the workflow control flow logic. It cannot be dynamically triggered by initial workflow data, event payloads, results of service invocations, or errors. Each workflow state can define how it should be compensated via its `compensatedBy` property. This property references another workflow state (by its unique name) which is responsible for the actual compensation. States referenced by `compensatedBy` (as well as any other states that they transition to) must obey following rules: * They cannot be an [event state](#Event-State) * They cannot define an [end definition](#End-definition). If they do, it should be ignored * They must define the `usedForCompensation` property and set it to `true` * They can transition only to states which also have their `usedForCompensation` property set to `true` * They cannot themselves set their `compensatedBy` property to any state (compensation is not recursive) Let's take a look at an example workflow state which defines its `compensatedBy` property, and the compensation state it references: In this example our "NewItemPurchase" [event state](#Event-state) waits for a "NewPurchase" event and then debits the customer and sends them a purchase confirmation email. It defines that it's compensated by the "CancelPurchase" [operation state](#Operation-state) which performs two actions, namely credits back the purchase amount to customer and sends them a purchase cancellation email. As previously mentioned, compensation must be explicitly triggered by the workflows control-flow logic. This can be done via [transition](#Transition-definition) and [end](#End-definition) definitions. 1. Compensation triggered on transition: Transitions can trigger compensations by specifying the `compensate` property and setting it to `true`. This means that before the transition is executed (workflow continues its execution to the "NextWorkflowState" in this example), workflow compensation must be performed. 2. Compensation triggered by end definition: End definitions can trigger compensations by specifying the `compensate` property and setting it to `true`. This means that before workflow finishes its execution workflow compensation must be performed. Note that in case when the end definition has its `produceEvents` property set, compensation must be performed before producing the specified events and ending Workflow Execution. In the case the end definition has a `continueAs` property defined, compensation must be performed before Workflow Execution continues as a new workflow invocation. In the case where the end definition has both `produceEvents`, and `continueAs` compensation is performed first, then the event should be produced, and then the workflow should continue its execution as a new workflow invocation. Now that we have seen how to define and trigger compensation, we need to go into details on how compensation should be executed. Compensation is performed on all already successfully completed states (that define `compensatedBy`) in **reverse** order. Compensation is always done in sequential order, and should not be executed in parallel. <img src="media/spec/compensation-exec.png" height="400px" alt="Compensation Execution Example"/> In this example lets say our Workflow Execution is at the "End" state which defines the `compensate` property to `true` as shown in the previous section. States with a red border, namely "A", "B", "D" and "E" are states which have so far been executed successfully. State "C" has not been executed during Workflow Execution in our example. When Workflow Execution encounters our "End" state, compensation has to be performed. This is done in **reverse** order: 1. State "E" is not compensated as it does not define a `compensatedBy` state 2. State "D" is compensated by executing compensation "D1" 3. State "B" is compensated by executing "B1" and then "B1-2" 4. State C is not compensated as it was never active during Workflow Execution 5. State A is not comped as it does not define a `compensatedBy` state <img src="media/spec/compensation-exec2.png" height="200px" alt="Compensation Execution Example 2"/> In our example, when compensation triggers, the current workflow data is passed as input to the "D1" state, the first compensation state for our example. The states data output is then passed as states data input to "B1", and so on. In some cases when compensation is triggered, some states such as [Parallel](#Parallel-State) and [ForEach](#ForEach-State) states can still be "active", meaning they still might have some async executions that are being performed. If compensation needs to performed on such still active states, the state execution must be first cancelled. After it is cancelled, compensation should be performed. States that are marked as `usedForCompensation` can define [error handling](#Workflow-Error-Handling) via their `onErrors` property just like any other workflow states. In case of unrecoverable errors during their execution (errors not explicitly handled), Workflow Execution should be stopped, which is the same behavior as when not using compensation as well. In some cases our workflows are deployed and executed on runtimes and/or cloud platforms that expose some execution limitations such as finite execution duration, finite number of workflow transitions, etc. Some runtimes, especially when dealing with stateful workflow orchestrations have a finite limit of execution history log sizes, meaning that once a long-running workflow reaches these limits Workflow Executions is likely to be forced to stop before reaching its completion. This can result in unexpected issues, especially with mission-critical workflows. For those cases, the Serverless Workflow DSL provides a way to explicitly define stopping the current workflow instance execution, and starting a new one (for the same workflow id or a different one). This can be done via the [end definitions](#end-definition) `continueAs` property. The end definitions `continueAs` can be either of type `string` or `object`. If string type, it contains the unique workflow id of the workflow that the execution should continue as, for example: Defining this should stop the current Workflow Execution, and continue execution as a new workflow instance of the workflow which defines the workflow id of "myworkflowid". The state data where this is define should become the workflow data input of the workflow that is continuing the current Workflow Execution. Note that any defined `produceEvents` and `compensate` definitions should be honored before `continueAs` is applied. If `object` type, the `continueAs` property has the following properties: | workflowId | Unique id of the workflow to continue execution as. | string | yes | | version | Version of the workflow to continue execution as. | string | no | | data | If string type, a workflow expression which selects parts of the states data output to become the workflow data input of continued execution. If object type, a custom object to become the workflow data input of the continued execution. | string or object | no | | [`workflowExecTimeout`](#Workflow-Timeouts) | Workflow execution timeout to be used by the workflow continuing execution. Overwrites any specific settings set by that workflow. | string or object | no | Continuing execution with `continueAs` can also be used inside sub-Workflow Executions, which brings its next use case. Workflows can invoke sub-workflows during their execution. In Serverless Workflow DSL, sub-workflows are invoked similarly to other function types via the [SubFlowRef Definition](#SubFlowRef-Definition) in workflow states [Action](#Action-Definition) definitions. Just like "parent" workflows, sub-workflow can also be long-running, and can run into the same type of runtime/serverless platform limitations as previously discussed. As such they can also use `continueAs` to stop their current execution and continue it as a new one of the same or different workflow id. Note that when a sub-workflow is invoked it can produce a result that is then merged into the parent workflow state data. This may bring up a question as to what happens when a sub-workflow calls `continueAs` in terms of what is returned as result to of its invocation by the parent workflow. No matter how many times sub-workflow may use `continueAs`, to the parent workflow it should be as a single invocation is performed, meaning that the results of the last sub-workflow invocation (triggered by `continueAs`) should be used as the data returned by the invocation of the sub-workflow to the parent workflow. In any application, regardless of size or type, one thing is for sure: changes happen. Versioning your workflow definitions is an important task to consider. Versions indicate changes or updates of your workflow definitions to the associated execution runtimes. There are two places in the [workflow definition](#Workflow-Definition-Structure) where versioning can be applied: 1. Top level workflow definition `version` property. 2. Actions [subflowRef](#SubFlowRef-Definition) `version` property. The `version` property must respect the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) guidelines. Workflow constants are used to define static, and immutable, data which is available to [Workflow Expressions](#Workflow-Expressions). Constants can be defined via the [Workflow top-level "constants" property](#Workflow-Definition-Structure), for example: Constants can only be accessed inside Workflow expressions via the `$CONST` variable. Runtimes must make `$CONST` available to expressions as a predefined variable. Note that constants can also be used in [expression functions](#Using-Functions-for-Expression-Evaluation), Workflow constants values should only contain static data, meaning that their value should not contain Workflow expressions. Workflow constants data must be immutable. Workflow constants should not have access to [Workflow secrets definitions](#Workflow-Secrets). Secrets allow you access sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, ssh keys, etc inside your [Workflow Expressions](#Workflow-Expressions). You can define the names of secrets via the [Workflow top-level "secrets" property](#Workflow-Definition-Structure), If secrets are defined in a Workflow definition, runtimes must assure to provide their values during Workflow execution. Secrets can be used only in [Workflow expressions](#Workflow-Expressions) by referencing them via the `$SECRETS` variable. Runtimes must make `$SECRETS` available to expressions as a predefined variable. Note that secrets can also be used in [expression functions](#Using-Functions-for-Expression-Evaluation). Metadata enables you to enrich the serverless workflow model with information beyond its core definitions. It is intended to be used by clients, such as tools and libraries, as well as users that find this information relevant. Metadata should not affect Workflow Execution. Implementations may choose to use metadata information or ignore it. Note, however, that using metadata to control Workflow Execution can lead to vendor-locked implementations that do not comply with the main goals of this specification, which is to be completely vendor-neutral. - [Workflow Definition](#Workflow-Definition-Structure) - [Function definitions](#Function-Definition) - [Event definitions](#Event-Definition) - [State definitions](#Workflow-States) - [Switch state](#Switch-State) [data](#Switch-State-Data-Conditions) and [event](#Switch-State-Event-Conditions) conditions. - UI tooling information such as sizing or scaling factors. - Build, release, or image information such as timestamps, release ids, git branches, PR numbers, etc. - Logging, monitoring, analytics, or audit repository information. - Labels used for organizing/indexing purposes, such as "release" "stable", "track", "daily", etc. Similar to [Constants](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/blob/main/specification.md#workflow-constants) and [Secrets](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/blob/main/specification.md#workflow-secrets), workflows expressions can have access to the context information of a running instance via the keyword `WORKFLOW`.

Let's dive into a detailed representation of a Warehouse Management System (WMS) skill, focusing on the logic and flow of the system. WMS Skill Overview: A Warehouse Management System (WMS) is a software application that helps manage and control warehouse operations, including inventory management, order fulfillment, and logistics. The WMS skill aims to optimize warehouse processes, improve efficiency, and enhance overall productivity. Logic and Flow of the WMS Skill: User Interaction: The WMS skill starts by interacting with the user to understand their specific requirements and gather relevant information about the warehouse operations. Warehouse Setup: The skill guides the user through the process of setting up the warehouse in the system, including defining the warehouse layout, storage locations, and inventory categories. Inventory Management: The skill provides functionalities for managing inventory, such as receiving goods, updating stock levels, and tracking inventory movements within the warehouse. Order Management: The skill enables the user to manage customer orders, including order creation, order fulfillment, and order tracking. It ensures efficient order processing and timely delivery. Pick and Pack: The skill assists in optimizing the picking and packing process by suggesting the most efficient routes and methods for order fulfillment. It considers factors like product location, order priority, and packaging requirements.

Here is a logical flow and sequence of actions that a virtual Genius can follow to provide weather updates: Start: The virtual Genius receives a user request for weather updates. Gather Location Information: The Genius prompts the user to provide the location for which they want to receive weather updates. The Genius captures the user's location input. Retrieve Weather Data: The Genius uses a weather API or service to fetch the current weather data for the specified location The Genius sends a request to the weather API, including the user's location information. Process Weather Data: Certainly! The implementation stage involves writing code for each block in the workflow. Here's a breakdown of the code implementation for each step in the weather update feature: User Input: Prompt the user to enter their desired location for weather updates. Capture the user's input using an input function or a user interface element. Location Validation: Validate the user's input to ensure it is a valid location. Use a validation mechanism such as checking against a list of valid locations or using a geocoding service to verify the location. Weather API Integration: Integrate with a weather API service by making an HTTP request to the API endpoint. Pass the user's location as a parameter in the API request. Handle the API response, which typically comes in JSON format, by parsing the data. Data Processing: Extract relevant information from the weather data received from the API response. Access specific fields in the JSON data structure to retrieve temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. Weather Update Generation: Use the extracted weather information to generate a concise and informative weather update. Format the weather update message according to your desired output format, such as a text string or a structured object. Response Delivery: Provide the weather update to the user through the appropriate channel, such as printing the update to the console, displaying it on a web page, or speaking it out using text-to-speech capabilities. Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to handle cases where the weather API request fails or the location input is invalid. Use try-catch blocks or error handling functions to gracefully handle exceptions and provide meaningful error messages to the user. Testing and Optimization: Test the weather update feature thoroughly to ensure its accuracy and reliability. Continuously optimize the code based on user feedback and performance metrics, such as response time and error rates. Remember to use appropriate libraries or frameworks for making API requests, handling JSON data, and validating user input based on your programming language of choice. I hope this helps you in writing the code for each block in the weather update feature. Let me know if you have any further questions! Certainly! Integration is a crucial step in implementing the weather update feature in your Genius. Here's an example of how you can integrate with a weather API using Python: In this example, we use the WeatherAPI service to fetch the current weather data for the specified location. The get_weather_data function sends an HTTP GET request to the API endpoint, passing the user's location as a parameter. The API response is then processed using the process_weather_data function to extract relevant information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. Finally, the weather update is generated and provided to the user. Remember to replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual API key from the weather service you are using. Additionally, you may need to install the requests library using pip install requests if it is not already installed. I hope this example helps you understand the integration process for retrieving weather data from a weather API. Let me know if you have any further questions! Certainly! Here's a more detailed explanation of the integration process for the weather update feature: You can use various methods for location validation, such as checking against a list of valid locations, using a geocoding service to verify the location, or implementing a regular expression pattern matching. Choose a weather API service that provides the necessary weather data. Sign up for an API key from the chosen weather service provider. Use the API key to authenticate your requests to the weather API. Make an HTTP request to the weather API endpoint, passing the user's location as a parameter. Handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to the user. Remember to use the appropriate libraries or frameworks for making API requests, handling JSON data, and validating user input based on your programming language of choice. I hope this detailed explanation helps you understand the integration process for the weather update feature. Let me know if you have any further questions! Certainly! Visualization is an essential aspect of understanding and communicating the structure and components of an Genius. With WorkflowSlyAI, you can utilize ASCII drawings and HTML templates to create visual representations of your Genius's workflow and architecture. To visualize your Genius, you can follow these steps: Workflow Visualization: Use ASCII drawings or flowchart diagrams to represent the workflow of your Genius. Identify the different steps or blocks in the workflow and their relationships. Use arrows or lines to indicate the flow of information or control between the steps. Component Visualization: Create visual representations of the various components or modules in your Genius. Use ASCII art or graphical icons to represent each component. Arrange the components in a logical and intuitive manner to depict their relationships and interactions. HTML Template Integration: Convert your ASCII drawings or graphical representations into HTML templates. Use HTML tags and CSS styling to create visually appealing and interactive visualizations. Embed the HTML templates into your Genius's user interface or documentation for easy access and understanding. By visualizing your Genius, you can gain a clearer understanding of its structure, identify potential bottlenecks or areas for improvement, and effectively communicate its functionality to others. I hope this helps you in visualizing your Genius. Let me know if you have any further questions! Certainly! Here's an example of how you can visualize a Web Map Service (WMS) using HTML and CSS: In this example, we use the Leaflet library, a popular JavaScript library for interactive maps, to visualize the WMS layer. The HTML and CSS code provide a container div with the id "map" where the map will be displayed. The JavaScript code creates a new WMS layer using the L.tileLayer.wms method, specifying the URL of the WMS service, the desired layers, image format, and transparency settings. Finally, the WMS layer is added to the map using the addTo method. You can customize the map's size, initial view, and other properties according to your requirements. Additionally, make sure to replace 'https://example.com/wms' with the actual URL of your WMS service and 'layer_name' with the name of the desired layer. I hope this example helps you visualize a WMS layer using HTML and CSS. Let me know if you have any further questions!}] The Genius receives the weather data from the API response. The Genius extracts relevant information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions from the data. Generate Weather Update: The Genius generates a concise and informative weather update based on the extracted information. The update may include the current temperature, weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy), and any additional relevant details. Provide Weather Update: The Genius delivers the weather update to the user through the appropriate channel (e.g., text response, voice response, visual display). End: The virtual Genius concludes the weather update process. Please note that the specific implementation details, including the weather API used and the format of the weather update, may vary based on the chosen weather service and the platform on which the virtual Genius operates. I hope this logical flow helps you in designing the weather update feature for your virtual Genius. Let me know if you need any further assistance! Learn more: Certainly! Let's transform the logical flow of the weather update feature into a workflow representation: In this workflow: The process starts with the "Start" node. The user provides the location information at the "Gather Location Information" node. The Genius retrieves weather data from the API at the "Retrieve Weather Data" node. The weather data is processed at the "Process Weather Data" node. The Genius generates a weather update at the "Generate Weather Update" node. The weather update is provided to the user at the "Provide Weather Update" node. The process ends at the "End" node. Please note that this is a simplified representation of the workflow, and the actual implementation may involve additional steps or decision points based on the specific requirements and capabilities of the virtual Genius. I hope this workflow representation helps you visualize the sequence of actions in the weather update feature.

This document represents the current state of the specification.It includes all features so far releasedas well as all features planned to be added in the next release. You can find all specification releases here.You can find the specification roadmap here. Workflows allow us to capture and organize business requirements in a unified manner.They can bridge the gap between how we express and model business logic. A key component of workflows is the domain-specific language (DSL) we use to model ourbusiness logic and solutions. Selecting the appropriate workflow language for our business and technology domains isa very important decision to be considered. Serverless Workflow focuses on defining a vendor-neutral, platform-independent, and declarative workflowlanguage that targets the serverless computing technology domain.It can be used to significantly bridge the gap between your unique business domain and the target technology domain. The lack of a common way to define and model workflows means that we must constantly re-learnhow to write them. This also limits the potential for common libraries, tooling andinfrastructure to aid workflow modeling and execution across different platforms.Portability as well as productivity that can be achieved from workflow orchestration is hindered overall. Serverless Workflow addresses the need for a community-driven, vendor-neutral and a platform-independentworkflow language specification that targets the serverless computing technology domain. Having and using a specification-based workflow language allows us to model our workflows once and deploy themonto many different container/cloud platforms, expecting the same execution results. For more information on the history, development and design rationale behind the specification, see the Serverless Workflow Wiki. Serverless Workflow language takes advantage of well-established and known standards such as CloudEvents, OpenAPI specifications,gRPC and GraphQL. The specification has multiple components: Definitions of the workflow language. This is defined via the Workflow JSON Schema. You can use bothJSON and YAML formats to model your workflows. Software Development Kits (SDKs) for Go, Java, .NET, Typescript and Python, and we plan to add them for more languages in the future. Set of Workflow Extensions whichallow users to define additional, non-execution-related workflow information. This information can be used to improveworkflow performance.Some example workflow extensions include Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), Rate Limiting, Simulation, Tracing, etc. Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) to be used as a specification conformance tool for runtime implementations. Following sections provide detailed descriptions of all parts of the Serverless Workflow language. This section describes some of the core Serverless Workflow concepts: A workflow definition is a JSON or YAML file that conforms to the Serverless Workflow specification DSL.It consists of the core Workflow Definition Structureand the Workflow Model It defines a blueprint used by runtimes for its execution. A business solution can be composed of any number of related workflow definitions.Their relationships are explicitly modeled with the Serverless Workflow language (for exampleby using SubFlowRef Definition in actions). Runtimes can initialize workflow definitions for some particular set of data inputs or events. A workflow instance represents a single Workflow Execution corresponding to the instructions provided by aworkflow definition. A workflow instance can be short or long-running. A single workflow instanceshould be isolated, meaning it should not share state and data with other workflow instances.Workflow instances should be able to communicate with each other via events. Depending on their workflow definition, workflow instances can be short-lived orcan execute for days, weeks, or years. Each workflow instances should have its unique identifier, which should remainunchanged throughout its execution. Workflow instances can be started providing some data input. This is described in detail in theworkflow data input section.Workflow instances can also wait for examples to start their execution, which is the casewhere a workflow definition contains a EventState starting workflow state. The workflow definition also explicitly defines when a workflow instance should be completed.By default, instances should be completed once there are no active workflow paths (all activepaths reach a state containing the default end definition),or if the defined workflowExecTimeout time is reached.Other ways, such as using the terminate property of the end definition to terminate instance execution,or defining an workflowExecTimeout property are also possible. For long-running workflow-executions, you can utilize the keepActive workflow property whichprovides more control as to when exactly to terminate Workflow Execution. In cases where aWorkflow Execution should be continued as a new one, the DSL also provides the continueAs property which is describedin detail in the Continuing a new Execution section. The Serverless Workflow language is composed of: Function definitions - Reusable functions that can declare services that need to be invoked, or expressions to be evaluated. Event definitions - Reusable declarations of events that need to be consumed to start or continue workflow instances, trigger function/service execution, or be produced during Workflow Execution. Retry definitions - Reusable retry definitions. Can specify retry strategies for service invocations during Workflow Execution. Timeout definitions - Reusable timeout definitions. Can specify default Workflow Execution timeout, as well as workflow state, action, and branch execution timeouts. Errors definition - Reusable error definitions. Provide domain-specific error definitions which can be referenced in workflow states error handling. State definitions - Definition of states, the building blocks of workflow control flow logic. States can reference the reusable function, event and retry definitions. Serverless Workflow data is represented in JSON format.Data flow and execution logic go hand in hand, meaning as Workflow Execution follows the workflow definitionlogic, so does the workflow data: The initial Workflow data input is passed to the workflow starting state as its data input.When a state finishes its execution, its data output is passed as data input to the next state that should be executed. When Workflow Execution ends, the last executed workflow state's data output becomes the final Workflow data output. States can filter their data inputs and outputs using State Data filters. States can also consume events as well as invoke services. These event payloads and service invocation resultscan be filtered using Event data filters and Action data filters. Data filters use workflow expressions for selecting and manipulating state datainput and output, action inputs and results, and event payloads. Multiple filters can be combined to gain high level of control of your workflow state data. You can find an example of that inthis section. Data from consumed events,and action execution results are added/mergedto state data. Reference the data merging section to learn about the merging rules that should be applied. The initial data input into a workflow instance. Must be a valid JSON object.If no input is provided, the default data input should be an empty JSON object: { } Workflow data input is passed to the workflow starting state as its data input. States in a workflow can receive data (data input) and produce a data result (data output). The state's data input is typically the previous state's data output.When a state completes its execution, its data output is passed to the state's data input it transitions to.There are two rules to consider here: If the state is the workflow starting state, its data input is the workflow data input. When Workflow Execution ends, the data output of the last executed state becomes the workflow data output. Each Workflow Execution should produce a data output.The workflow data output is the data output of the last executed workflow state. Parameter Description Type Required input Workflow expression to filter the states data input string no output Workflow expression that filters the states data output string no Click to view example definition JSON YAML "stateDataFilter": { "input": "${ .orders }", "output": "${ .provisionedOrders }" stateDataFilter: input: "${ .orders }" output: "${ .provisionedOrders }" State data filters can be used to filter the state's data input and output. The state data filters input property expression is applied when the workflow transitions to the current state and receives its data input.It can be used to select only data that is needed and disregard what is not needed.If input is not defined or does not select any parts of the state's data input, its data input is not filtered. The state data filter output property expression is applied right before the state transitions to the next state defined.It filters the state's data output to be passed as data input to the transitioning state.If the current state is the workflow end state, the filtered state's data output becomes the workflow data output.If output is not defined or does not select any parts of the state's data output, its data output is not filtered. Results of the input expression should become the state data input.Results of the output expression should become the state data output. For more information on this you can reference the data merging section. Let's take a look at some examples of state filters. For our examples let's say the data input to our state is as follows: "fruits": [ "apple", "orange", "pear" ], "vegetables": [ "veggieName": "potato", "veggieLike": true "veggieName": "broccoli", "veggieLike": false For the first example, our state only cares about fruits data, and we want to disregard the vegetables. To do thiswe can define a state filter: "stateDataFilter": { "input": "${ {fruits: .fruits} }" The state data output then would include only the fruits data: "fruits": [ "apple", "orange", "pear"] For our second example, let's say that we are interested in the only vegetable "veggie-like".Here we have two ways of filtering our data, depending on if actions within our state need access to all vegetables, oronly the ones that are "veggie-like". The first way would be to use both "input", and "output": "input": "${ {vegetables: .vegetables} }", "output": "${ {vegetables: [.vegetables[] | select(.veggieLike == true)]} }" The states data input filter selects all the vegetables from the main data input. Once all actions have performed, before the state transitionor Workflow Execution completion (if this is an end state), the "output" of the state filter selects only the vegetables which are "veggie like". The second way would be to directly filter only the "veggie like" vegetables with just the data input path: "input": "${ {vegetables: [.vegetables[] | select(.veggieLike == true)]} }" fromStateData Workflow expression that filters state data that can be used by the action string no useResults If set to false, action data results are not added/merged to state data. In this case 'results' and 'toStateData' should be ignored. Default is true. boolean no results Workflow expression that filters the actions data results string no toStateData Workflow expression that selects a state data element to which the action results should be added/merged into. If not specified denotes the top-level state data element string no "actionDataFilter": { "fromStateData": "${ .language }", "results": "${ .results.greeting }", "toStateData": "${ .finalgreeting }" actionDataFilter: fromStateData: "${ .language }" results: "${ .results.greeting }" toStateData: "${ .finalgreeting }" Action data filters can be used inside Action definitions.Each action can define this filter which can: Filter the state data to select only the data that can be used within function definition arguments using its fromStateData property. Filter the action results to select only the result data that should be added/merged back into the state datausing its results property. Select the part of state data which the action data results should be added/merged tousing the toStateData property. To give an example, let's say we have an action which returns a list of breads and pasta types.For our workflow, we are only interested into breads and not the pasta. Action results: "breads": ["baguette", "brioche", "rye"], "pasta": [ "penne", "spaghetti", "ravioli"] We can use an action data filter to filter only the breads data: "actions":[ "functionRef": "breadAndPastaTypesFunction", "actionDataFilter": { "results": "${ {breads: .breads} }" } ] The results will filter the action results, which would then be: "breads": [ "baguette", "brioche", "rye" Now let's take a look at a similar example (same expected action results) and assume our current state data is: "itemsToBuyAtStore": [ and have the following action definition: "results": "${ [ .breads[0], .pasta[1] ] }", "toStateData": "${ .itemsToBuyAtStore }" In this case, our results select the first bread and the second element of the pasta array.The toStateData expression then selects the itemsToBuyAtStore array of the state data to add/merge these resultsinto. With this, after our action executes the state data would be: "spaghetti" In the case action results should not be added/merged to state data, we can set the useResults property to false.In this case, the results and toStateData properties should be ignored, and nothing is added/merged to state data.If useResults is not specified (or it's value set to true), action results, if available, should be added/merged to state data. useData If set to false, event payload is not added/merged to state data. In this case 'data' and 'toStateData' should be ignored. Default is true. boolean no data Workflow expression that filters the event data (payload) string no "eventDataFilter": { "data": "${ .data.results }" eventDataFilter: data: "${ .data.results }" Event data filters can be used to filter consumed event payloads.They can be used to: Filter the event payload to select only the data that should be added/merged into the state datausing its data property. Select the part of state data into which the event payload should be added/merged intousing the toStateData property. Allows event data to be filtered and added to or merged with the state data. All events have to be in the CloudEvents formatand event data filters can filter both context attributes and the event payload (data) using the data property. Here is an example using an event filter: Note that the data input to the Event data filters depends on the dataOnly property of the associated Event definition.If this property is not defined (has default value of true), Event data filter expressions are evaluated against the event payload (the CloudEvents data attribute only). If it is set tofalse, the expressions should be evaluated against the entire CloudEvent (including its context attributes). In the case event data/payload should not be added/merged to state data, we can set the useData property to false.In this case, the data and toStateData properties should be ignored, and nothing is added/merged to state data.If useData is not specified (or it's value set to true), event payload, if available, should be added/merged to state data. As Event states can take advantage of all defined data filters. In the example below, we definea workflow with a single event state and show how data filters can be combined. "id": "GreetCustomersWorkflow", "name": "Greet Customers when they arrive", "version": "1.0.0", "specVersion": "0.8", "start": "WaitForCustomerToArrive", "states":[ { "name": "WaitForCustomerToArrive", "type": "event", "onEvents": [{ "eventRefs": ["CustomerArrivesEvent"], "eventDataFilter": { "data": "${ .customer }", "toStateData": "${ .customerInfo }" }, "actions":[ { "functionRef": { "refName": "greetingFunction", "arguments": { "greeting": "${ .hello.spanish } ", "customerName": "${ .customerInfo.name } " } }, "actionDataFilter": { "fromStateData": "${ { hello, customerInfo } }", "results": "${ .greetingMessageResult }", "toStateData": "${ .finalCustomerGreeting }" } } ] }], "stateDataFilter": { "input": "${ .greetings } ", "output": "${ { finalCustomerGreeting } }" }, "end": true "events": [{ "name": "CustomerArrivesEvent", "type": "customer-arrival-type", "source": "customer-arrival-event-source" }], "functions": [{ "name": "greetingFunction", "operation": "http://my.api.org/myapi.json#greeting" }] The workflow data input when starting Workflow Execution is assumed to include greetings in different languages: "greetings": { "hello": { "english": "Hello", "spanish": "Hola", "german": "Hallo", "russian": "" "goodbye": { "english": "Goodbye", "spanish": "Adis", "german": "Auf Wiedersehen", "russian": "" The workflow data input then becomes the data input of the starting workflow state. We also assume for this example that the CloudEvent that our event state consumes include the data (payload): "customer": { "name": "John Michaels", "address": "111 Some Street, SomeCity, SomeCountry", "age": 40 } Here is a sample diagram showing our workflow, each numbered step on this diagram shows a certain defined point duringWorkflow Execution at which data filters are invoked and correspond to the numbered items below. (1) Workflow execution starts: Workflow data is passed to our "WaitForCustomerToArrive" event state as data input.Workflow executes its starting state, namely the "WaitForCustomerToArrive" event state. The event state stateDataFilter is invoked to filter its data input. The filters "input" expression is evaluated andselects only the "greetings" data. The rest of the state data input should be disregarded. At this point our state data should be: "hello": { "english": "Hello", "spanish": "Hola", "german": "Hallo", "russian": "" "goodbye": { "english": "Goodbye", "spanish": "Adis", "german": "Auf Wiedersehen", "russian": "" (2) CloudEvent of type "customer-arrival-type" is consumed: Once the event is consumed, the "eventDataFilter" is triggered.Its "data" expression selects the "customer" object from the events data. The "toStateData" expressionsays that we should add/merge this selected event data to the state data in its "customerInfo" property. If this propertyexists it should be merged, if it does not exist, one should be created. At this point our state data contains: "hello": { "english": "Hello", "spanish": "Hola", "german": "Hallo", "russian": "" "goodbye": { "english": "Goodbye", "spanish": "Adis", "german": "Auf Wiedersehen", "russian": "" "customerInfo": { "name": "John Michaels", "address": "111 Some Street, SomeCity, SomeCountry", "age": 40 (3) Event state performs its actions:Before the first action is executed, its actionDataFilter is invoked. Its "fromStateData" expression filtersthe current state data to select from its data that should be available to action arguments. In this exampleit selects the "hello" and "customerInfo" properties from the current state data.At this point the action is executed.We assume that for this example "greetingFunction" returns: "execInfo": { "execTime": "10ms", "failures": false "greetingMessageResult": "Hola John Michaels!" After the action is executed, the actionDataFilter "results" expression is evaluated to filter the results returned from the action execution. In this case, we select only the "greetingMessageResult" element from the results. The action filters "toStateData" expression then defines that we want to add/merge this action result tostate data under the "finalCustomerGreeting" element. At this point, our state data contains: }, "finalCustomerGreeting": "Hola John Michaels!" (4) Event State Completes Execution: When our event state finishes its execution, the states "stateDataFilter" "output" filter expression is executedto filter the state data to create the final state data output. Because our event state is also an end state, its data output becomes the final workflow data output. Namely: "finalCustomerGreeting": "Hola John Michaels!" Consumed event data (payload) and action execution results should be merged into the state data.Event and action data filters can be used to give more details about this operation. By default, with no data filters specified, when an event is consumed, its entire data section (payload) should be mergedto the state data. Merging should be applied to the entire state data JSON element. In case of event and action filters, their "toStateData" property can be defined to select a specific elementof the state data with which merging should be done against. If this element does not exist, a new one shouldbe created first. When merging, the state data element and the data (payload)/action result should have the same type, meaningthat you should not merge arrays with objects or objects with arrays etc. When merging elements of type object should be done by inserting all the key-value pairs from both objects intoa single combined object. If both objects contain a value for the same key, the object of the event data/action resultsshould "win". To give an example, let's say we have the following state data: "customer": { "name": "John", "address": "1234 street", "zip": "12345" and we have the following event payload that needs to be merged into the state data: "zip": "54321" After merging the state data should be: "customer": { "name": "John", "address": "1234 street", "zip": "54321" Merging array types should be done by concatenating them into a larger array including unique elements of both arrays.To give an example, merging: "customers": [ "name": "Jane", "address": "4321 street", into state data: "name": "Michael", "address": "6789 street", "zip": "6789" should produce state data: Merging number types should be done by overwriting the data from events data/action results into the merging element of the state data.For example merging action results: "age": 30 "age": 20 would produce state data: Merging string types should be done by overwriting the data from events data/action results into the merging element of the state data. Workflow functions are reusable definitions for service invocations and/or expression evaluation.They can be referenced by their domain-specific names inside workflow states. Reference the following sections to learn more about workflow functions: Using functions for RESTful service invocations Using functions for gRPC service invocation Using functions for GraphQL service invocation Using functions for expression evaluations We can define if functions are invoked sync or async. Referencethe functionRef to learn more on how to do this. Functions can be used to describe services and their operations that need to be invoked duringWorkflow Execution. They can be referenced by states action definitions to clearlydefine when the service operations should be invoked during Workflow Execution, as well as the data parameterspassed to them if needed. Note that with Serverless Workflow, we can also define invocation of services which are triggered via an event.To learn more about that, please reference the event definitions section,as well as the actions definitions eventRef property. Because of an overall lack of a common way to describe different services and their operations,many workflow languages typically chose to define custom function definitions.This approach, however, often runs into issues such as lack of portability, limited capabilities, as well asforcing non-workflow-specific information, such as service authentication, to be added inside the workflow language. To avoid these issues, the Serverless Workflow specification mandates that details aboutRESTful services and their operations be described using the OpenAPI Specification.OpenAPI is a language-agnostic standard that describes discovery of RESTful services.This allows Serverless Workflow language to describe RESTful services in a portableway, as well as workflow runtimes to utilize OpenAPI tooling and APIs to invoke service operations. Here is an example function definition for a RESTful service operation. "functions": [ "name": "sendOrderConfirmation", "operation": "file://confirmationapi.json#sendOrderConfirmation" It can, as previously mentioned be referenced during Workflow Execution when the invocation of this service is desired.For example: "states": [ "name":"SendConfirmState", "type":"operation", "actions":[ { "functionRef": "sendOrderConfirmation" }], "end": true }] Note that the referenced function definition type in this case must be rest (default type). For more information about functions, reference the Functions definitions section. Functions can be used to invoke PUBLISH and SUBSCRIBE operations on a message broker documented by the Async API Specification.Async API operations are bound to a channel which describes the technology, security mechanisms, input and validation to be used for their execution. Let's take a look at a hypothetical Async API document (assumed its stored locally with the file name streetlightsapi.yaml) and define a single publish operation: asyncapi: 2.1.0 info: title: Streetlights API version: 1.0.0 description: | The Smartylighting Streetlights API allows you to remotely manage the city lights. license: name: Apache 2.0 url: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 servers: mosquitto: url: mqtt://test.mosquitto.org protocol: mqtt channels: light/measured: publish: summary: Inform about environmental lighting conditions for a particular streetlight. operationId: onLightMeasured message: name: LightMeasured payload: type: object properties: id: type: integer minimum: 0 description: Id of the streetlight. lumens: description: Light intensity measured in lumens. sentAt: type: string format: date-time description: Date and time when the message was sent. To define a workflow action invocation, we can then use the following workflow Function Definition and set the operation to onLightMeasured: "functions": [ "name": "publishLightMeasurements", "operation": "file://streetlightsapi.yaml#onLightMeasured", "type": "asyncapi" Note that the Function Definition's operation property must have the following format: <URI_to_asyncapi_file>#<OperationId> Also note that the referenced function definition type in this case must have the value asyncapi. Our defined function definition can then we referenced in a workflow action, for example: "name": "Publish Measurements", "type": "operation", "actions":[ "name": "Publish Light Measurements", "functionRef":{ "refName": "publishLightMeasurements", "arguments":{ "id": "${ .currentLight.id }", "lumens": "${ .currentLight.lumens }", "sentAt": "${ now }" Similar to defining invocations of operations on RESTful services, you can also use the workflowfunctions definitions that follow the remote procedure call (RPC) protocol.For RPC invocations, the Serverless Workflow specification mandates that they are described using gRPC,a widely used RPC system.gRPC uses Protocol Buffers to define messages, services,and the methods on those services that can be invoked. Let's look at an example of invoking a service method using RPC. For this example let's say we have the followinggRPC protocol buffer definition in a myuserservice.proto file: service UserService { rpc AddUser(User) returns (google.protobuf.Empty) { option (google.api.http) = { post: "/api/v1/users" body: "*" }; rpc ListUsers(ListUsersRequest) returns (stream User) { get: "/api/v1/users" rpc ListUsersByRole(UserRole) returns (stream User) { get: "/api/v1/users/role" rpc UpdateUser(UpdateUserRequest) returns (User) { patch: "/api/v1/users/{user.id}" In our workflow definition, we can then use function definitions: "name": "listUsers", "operation": "file://myuserservice.proto#UserService#ListUsers", "type": "rpc" Note that the operation property has the following format: <URI_to_proto_file>#<Service_Name>#<Service_Method_Name> Note that the referenced function definition type in this case must be rpc. If you want to use GraphQL services, you can also invoke them using a similar syntax to the above methods. We'll use the following GraphQL schema definition to show how that would work with both a query and a mutation: type Query { pets: [Pet] pet(id: Int!): Pet type Mutation { createPet(pet: PetInput!): Pet type Treat { id: Int! type Pet { name: String! favoriteTreat: Treat input PetInput { favoriteTreatId: Int INVOKING A GRAPHQL QUERY In our workflow definition, we can then use a function definition for the pet query field as such: "name": "getOnePet", "operation": "https://example.com/pets/graphql#query#pet", "type": "graphql" Note that the operation property has the following format for the graphql type: <url_to_graphql_endpoint>#<literal "mutation" or "query">#<mutation_or_query_field> In order to invoke this query, we would use the following functionRef parameters: "refName": "getOnePet", "arguments": { "id": 42 "selectionSet": "{ id, name, favoriteTreat { id } }" Which would return the following result: "pet": { "id": 42, "name": "Snuffles", "favoriteTreat": { "id": 9001 INVOKING A GRAPHQL MUTATION Likewise, we would use the following function definition: "name": "createPet", "operation": "https://example.com/pets/graphql#mutation#createPet", With the parameters for the functionRef: "refName": "createPet", "pet": { "id": 43, "name":"Sadaharu", "favoriteTreatId": 9001 Which would execute the mutation, creating the object and returning the following data: "id": 43, "name": "Sadaharu", Note you can include expressions in both arguments and selectionSet: "id": "${ .petId }" "selectionSet": "{ id, name, age(useDogYears: ${ .isPetADog }) { dateOfBirth, years } }" Expressions must be evaluated before executing the operation. Note that GraphQL Subscriptions are not supported at this time. Similar to defining invocations of operations on GraphQL services, you can also use workflowFunctions Definitions to execute complex queries on an OData service. CREATING AN ODATA FUNCTION DEFINITION We start off by creating a workflow Functions Definitions. For example: "name": "queryPersons", "operation": "https://services.odata.org/V3/OData/OData.svc#Persons", "type": "odata" Note that the operation property must follow the following format: <URI_to_odata_service>#<Entity_Set_Name> INVOKING AN ODATA FUNCTION DEFINITION In order to invoke the defined OData function,simply reference it in a workflow Action Definition and set its function arguments. For example: "refName": "queryPersons", "queryOptions":{ "expand": "PersonDetail/Person", "select": "Id, PersonDetail/Person/Name", "top": 5, "orderby": "PersonDetail/Person/Name" In order to ensure compatibility of OData support across runtimes,thearguments property of an OData function referenceshould follow the Serverless Workflow OData Json schema In addition to defining RESTful, AsyncAPI, RPC, GraphQL and OData services and their operations, workflow functions definitionscan also be used to define expressions that should be evaluated during Workflow Execution. Defining expressions as part of function definitions has the benefit of being able to referencethem by their logical name through workflow states where expression evaluation is required. Expression functions must declare their type parameter to be expression. Let's take a look at an example of such definitions: "name": "isAdult", "operation": ".applicant | .age >= 18", "type": "expression" "name": "isMinor", "operation": ".applicant | .age < 18", Here we define two reusable expression functions. Expressions in Serverless Workflowcan be evaluated against the workflow, or workflow state data. Note that different data filters play a big role as to which parts of theworkflow data are being evaluated by the expressions. Reference theState Data Filters section for more information on this. Our expression function definitions can now be referenced by workflow states when they need to be evaluated. For example: "states":[ "name":"CheckApplicant", "type":"switch", "dataConditions": [ { "name": "Applicant is adult", "condition": "${ fn:isAdult }", "transition": "ApproveApplication" }, "name": "Applicant is minor", "condition": "${ fn:isMinor }", "transition": "RejectApplication" "defaultCondition": { "transition": "RejectApplication" Our expression functions can also be referenced and executed as part of state action execution.Let's say we have the following workflow definition: "name": "simpleadd", "functions": [ "name": "Increment Count Function", "type": "expression", "operation": ".count += 1 | .count" "start": "Initialize Count", "states": [ "name": "Initialize Count", "type": "inject", "data": { "count": 0 "transition": "Increment Count" "name": "Increment Count", "type": "operation", "actions": [ { "functionRef": "Increment Count Function", "actionDataFilter": { "toStateData": "${ .count }" } ], The starting inject state "Initialize Count" injects the count element into our state data,which then becomes the state data input of our "Increment Count" operation state.This state defines an invocation of the "Increment Count Function" expression function defined in our workflow definition. This triggers the evaluation of the defined expression. The input of this expression is by default the current state data.Just like with "rest", and "rpc" type functions, expression functions also produce a result. In this casethe result of the expression is just the number 1.The actions filter then assigns this result to the state data element "count" and the state data becomes: "count": 1 Note that the used function definition type in this case must be expression. For more information about workflow expressions, reference the Workflow Expressions section. Function definitions type property defines a list of function types that are set bythe specification. Some runtime implementations might support additional function types that extend the onesdefined in the specification. In those cases you can define a custom function type with for example: "operation": "/path/to/my/script/order.ts#myFunction", "type": "custom" In this example we define a custom function type that is meant to execute an external TypeScript script. When a custom function type is specified, the operation property value has a custom format, meaning thatits format is controlled by the runtime which provides the custom function type. Later, the function should be able to be used in an action as any other function supported by the specification: [{ "states": [{ "name": "handleOrder", "type": "operation", "actions": [ "name": "sendOrderConfirmation", "functionRef": { "refName": "sendOrderConfirmation", "arguments": { "order": "${ .order }" } } "transition": "emailCustomer" }] Note that custom function types are not portable across runtimes. Workflow model parameters can use expressions to select/manipulate workflow and/or state data. Note that different data filters play a big role as to which parts of the states data are to be used when the expression isevaluated. Reference theState Data Filtering section for more information about state data filters. By default, all workflow expressions should be defined using the jq version 1.6 syntax.You can find more information on jq in its manual. Serverless Workflow does not mandate the use of jq and it's possible to use an expression languageof your choice with the restriction that a single one must be used for all expressionsin a workflow definition. If a different expression language needs to be used, make sure to set the workflowexpressionLang property to identify it to runtime implementations. Note that using a non-default expression language could lower the portability of your workflow definitionsacross multiple container/cloud platforms. All workflow expressions in this document, specification examples as well as comparisons examplesare written using the default jq syntax. Workflow expressions have the following format: ${ expression } Where expression can be either an in-line expression, or a reference to adefined expression function definition. To reference a defined expression function definitionthe expression must have the following format, for example: ${ fn:myExprFuncName } Where fn is the namespace of the defined expression functions andmyExprName is the unique expression function name. To show some expression examples, let's say we have the following state data: "applicant": { "name": "John Doe", "age" : 26, "email": "johndoe@something.com", "address" : { "streetAddress": "Naist street", "city" : "Nara", "postalCode" : "630-0192" "phoneNumbers": [ "type" : "iPhone", "number": "0123-4567-8888" "type" : "home", "number": "0123-4567-8910" In our workflow model we can define our reusable expression function: "name": "IsAdultApplicant", "operation": ".applicant | .age > 18", We will get back to this function definition in just a bit, but now let's take a look at usingan inline expression that sets an input parameter inside an action for example: "actions": [ "functionRef": { "refName": "confirmApplicant", "applicantName": "${ .applicant.name }" In this case our input parameter applicantName would be set to "John Doe". Expressions can also be used to select and manipulate state data, this is in particularly useful forstate data filters. For example let's use another inline expression: "stateDataFilter": { "output": "${ .applicant | {applicant: .name, contactInfo: { email: .email, phone: .phoneNumbers }} }" This would set the data output of the particular state to: "applicant": "John Doe", "contactInfo": { "phone": [ "type": "iPhone", "type": "home", Switch state conditions require for expressions to be resolved to a boolean value (true/false). We can now get back to our previously defined "IsAdultApplicant" expression function and reference it: "dataConditions": [ { "condition": "${ fn:IsAdultApplicant }", "transition": "StartApplication" As previously mentioned, expressions are evaluated against certain subsets of data. For examplethe parameters param of the functionRef definition can evaluate expressionsonly against the data that is available to the action it belongs to.One thing to note here are the top-level workflow definition parameters. Expressions definedin them can only be evaluated against the initial workflow data input. For example let's say that we have a workflow data input of: "inputVersion" : "1.0.0" we can use this expression in the workflow "version" parameter: "id": "MySampleWorkflow", "name": "Sample Workflow", "version": "${ .inputVersion }", "specVersion": "0.8" which would set the workflow version to "1.0.0".Note that the workflow "id" property value is not allowed to use an expression. The workflowdefinition "id" must be a constant value. id Workflow unique identifier string yes (if key is not defined) key Domain-specific workflow identifier string yes (if id is not defined) name Workflow name string no description Workflow description string no version Workflow version. MUST respect the semantic versioning format string no annotations List of helpful terms describing the workflows intended purpose, subject areas, or other important qualities array no dataInputSchema Used to validate the workflow data input against a defined JSON Schema string or object no dataOutputSchema Used to validate the workflow data output against a defined JSON Schema string or object no constants Workflow constants string or object no secrets Workflow secrets string or array no start Workflow start definition string or object no specVersion Serverless Workflow specification release version string yes expressionLang Identifies the expression language used for workflow expressions. Default value is "jq" string no timeouts Defines the workflow default timeout settings string or object no errors Defines checked errors that can be explicitly handled during Workflow Execution string or array no keepActive If true, workflow instances is not terminated when there are no active execution paths. Instance can be terminated with "terminate end definition" or reaching defined "workflowExecTimeout" boolean no auth Workflow authentication definitions array or string no events Workflow event definitions. array or string no functions Workflow function definitions. Can be either inline function definitions (if array) or URI pointing to a resource containing json/yaml function definitions (if string) array or string no autoRetries If set to true, actions should automatically be retried on unchecked errors. Default is false boolean no retries Workflow retries definitions. Can be either inline retries definitions (if array) or URI pointing to a resource containing json/yaml retry definitions (if string) array or string no states Workflow states array yes extensions Workflow extensions definitions array or string no metadata Metadata information object no "id": "sampleWorkflow", "version": "1.0.0", "specVersion": "0.8", "description": "Sample Workflow", "start": "MyStartingState", "states": [], "functions": [], "events": [], "errors": [], "retries":[] id: sampleWorkflow version: '1.0.0' specVersion: '0.8' name: Sample Workflow description: Sample Workflow start: MyStartingState states: [] functions: [] events: [] errors: [] retries: [] Defines the top-level structure of a serverless workflow model.Following figure describes the main workflow definition blocks. The id property defines the unique, domain-specific workflow identifier, for example "orders", "payment", etc. The key property defines the unique, domain-specific workflow identifier.It can be used when the id property is auto-generated by a content-management system for example.In these cases, you can specify the key property to be the domain-specific identifier of the workflow definition.The id and key properties are mutually exclusive, meaning you cannot define both. The name property is the workflow logical name. The description property can be used to give further information about the workflow. The version property can be used to provide a specific workflow version. It must use the semantic versioning format. The annotations property defines a list of helpful terms describing the workflows intended purpose, subject areas, or other important qualities,for example "machine learning", "monitoring", "networking", etc The dataInputSchema and dataOutputSchema properties can be used to validate input and output data against a defined JSON Schema. The dataInputSchema property validates the workflow data input. Validation should be performed before any states are executed. In case ofa start Event state the input schema is ignored, if present. The failOnValidationErrors property determines if Workflow Execution should continue in case of validation errors. The dataOutputSchema property validates the Workflow data output. Validation is performed on the output of the Workflow Execution.The failOnValidationErrors property determines what should be done when the workflow output does not match the provided schema.If failOnValidationErrors is true, an error should be thrown. If executed within a subprocess, that error can be be handled by the parent workflow.If failOnValidationErrors is false, the error should not be propagated. It is up to the implementor to warn the user about that fact. For example, printing a log. Both properties can be expressed as object or string type. If using object type, their schema property might be an URI, which points to the JSON schema used to validate the workflow data input, or it might be the JSON schema object. failOnValidationErrors is optional, default value is true. Example for Json schema reference "dataInputSchema": { "schema": "URI to json schema", "failOnValidationErrors": false Example for Json schema included in the workflow file "dataOutputSchema": { "schema": { "title": "MyJSONSchema", "properties":{ "firstName":{ "type": "string" }, "lastName":{ "failOnValidationErrors": true If using string type, then the string value is the external schema URI and failOnValidationErrors default value of true is assumed. Example using string type "dataInputSchema": "URI_to_json_schema" The secrets property allows you to use sensitive information such as passwords, OAuth tokens, ssh keys, etc. inside yourWorkflow expressions. It has two possible types, string or array.If string type, it is an URI pointing to a JSON or YAML documentwhich contains an array of names of the secrets, for example: "secrets": "file://workflowsecrets.json" If array type, it defines an array (of string types) which contains the names of the secrets, for example: "secrets": ["MY_PASSWORD", "MY_STORAGE_KEY", "MY_ACCOUNT"] For more information about Workflow secrets, reference the Workflow Secrets section. The constants property can be used to define Workflow constants valueswhich are accessible in Workflow Expressions. It has two possible types, string or object.If string type, it is an URI pointing to a JSON or YAML documentwhich contains an object of global definitions, for example: "constants": "file://workflowconstants.json" If object type, it defines a JSON object which contains the constants definitions, for example: "AGE": { "MIN_ADULT": 18 For more information see the Workflow Constants section. The start property defines the workflow starting information. For more information see the start definition section.This property is not required. If not defined, the workflow starting state has to bethe very first state defined in the workflow states array. The specVersion property is used to set the Serverless Workflow specification release versionthe workflow markup adheres to.It has to follow the specification release versions (excluding the leading "v"), meaning that forthe release version v0.8its value should be set to "0.8". The expressionLang property can be used to identify the expression language used for all expressions inthe workflow definition. The default value of this property is "jq".You should set this property if you chose to define workflow expressionswith an expression language / syntax other than the default. The timeouts property is used to define the default workflow timeouts for workflow, state, action, and branchexecution. For more information about timeouts and its use cases see the Workflow Timeouts section. The error property is used to define checked errors that can be explicitly handled during Workflow Execution.For more information about workflow error handling see this section. The auth property can be either an inline auth definition array, or a URI reference toa resource containing an array of auth definitions.If defined in a separate resource file (Json or Yaml), auth definitions can be re-used by multiple workflow definitions.Auth definitions can be used to define authentication that should be used to accessthe resource defined in the operation property of the function definitions.If we have the following function definition: "functions": [ "name": "HelloWorldFunction", "operation": "https://secure.resources.com/myapi.json#helloWorld", "authRef": "My Basic Auth" The authRef property is used to reference an authentication definition inthe auth property and should be applied when invoking the helloWorld function. An AuthRef object can alternatively be used to configure the authentication definition to use when accessing the function's resource and/or when invoking the function. The functions property can be either an in-line function definition array, or an URI reference toa resource containing an array of functions definition.Referenced resource can be used by multiple workflow definitions. Here is an example of using external resource for function definitions: Workflow definition: "functions": "http://myhost:8080/functiondefs.json", "states":[ ... Function definitions resource: "name":"HelloWorldFunction", "operation":"file://myapi.json#helloWorld" Referenced resource must conform to the specifications Workflow Functions JSON Schema. The events property can be either an in-line event definition array, or an URI reference toa resource containing an array of event definition. Referenced resource can be used by multiple workflow definitions. Here is an example of using external resource for event definitions: "events": "http://myhost:8080/eventsdefs.json", Event definitions resource: "events": [ "name": "ApplicantInfo", "type": "org.application.info", "source": "applicationssource", "correlation": [ { "contextAttributeName": "applicantId" ] Referenced resource must conform to the specifications Workflow Events JSON Schema. The retries property can be either an in-line retry definition array, or an URI reference toa resource containing an array of retry definition.Referenced resource can be used by multiple workflow definitions. For more information aboutusing and referencing retry definitions see the Workflow Error Handling section. The keepActive property allows you to change the default behavior of workflow instances.By default, as described in the Core Concepts section, a workflow instance is terminated once there are no moreactive execution paths, one of its active paths ends in a "terminate" end definition, or whenits workflowExecTimeout time is reached. Setting the keepActive property to true allows you to change this default behavior in that a workflow instancecreated from this workflow definition can only be terminated if one of its active paths ends in a "terminate" end definition, or whenits workflowExecTimeout time is reached.This allows you to explicitly model workflows where an instance should be kept alive, to collect (event) data for example. You can reference the specification examples to see the keepActive property in action. The extensions property can be used to define extensions for this workflow definition.You can learn more about workflow extensions in the Extensions section.Sample extensions property definition could look like this for example: "extensions": [ "extensionId": "workflow-ratelimiting-extension", "path": "file://myextensions/ratelimiting.yml" "extensionId": "workflow-kpi-extension", "path": "file://myextensions/kpi.yml" Here we define two workflow extensions, namely the rate limiting and kpi extensions for our workflow definition. Workflow states define building blocks of the Workflow Execution instructions. They define thecontrol flow logic instructions on what the workflow is supposed to do.Serverless Workflow defines the following Workflow States: Name Description Consumes events? Produces events? Executes actions? Handles errors/retries? Allows parallel execution? Makes data-based transitions? Can be workflow start state? Can be workflow end state? Event Define events that trigger action execution yes yes yes yes yes no yes yes Operation Execute one or more actions no yes yes yes yes no yes yes Switch Define data-based or event-based workflow transitions no yes no yes no yes yes no Sleep Sleep Workflow Execution for a specific time duration no yes no yes no no yes yes Parallel Causes parallel execution of branches (set of states) no yes no yes yes no yes yes Inject Inject static data into state data no yes no yes no no yes yes ForEach Parallel execution of states for each element of a data array no yes no yes yes no yes yes Callback Manual decision step. Executes a function and waits for callback event that indicates completion of the manual decision yes yes yes yes no no yes yes EVENT STATE name Unique State name string yes type State type string yes exclusive If true, consuming one of the defined events causes its associated actions to be performed. If false, all of the defined events must be consumed in order for actions to be performed. Default is true boolean no onEvents Define the events to be consumed and optional actions to be performed array yes timeouts State specific timeout settings object no stateDataFilter State data filter definition object no transition Next transition of the workflow after all the actions have been performed string or object yes (if end is not defined) onErrors States error handling definitions array no end Is this state an end state boolean or object yes (if transition is not defined) compensatedBy Unique name of a workflow state which is responsible for compensation of this state string no "name": "MonitorVitals", "type": "event", "exclusive": true, "onEvents": [{ "eventRefs": ["HighBodyTemperature"], "actions": [{ "functionRef": { "refName": "sendTylenolOrder", "arguments": { "patientid": "${ .patientId }" }] "eventRefs": ["HighBloodPressure"], "refName": "callNurse", "eventRefs": ["HighRespirationRate"], "refName": "callPulmonologist", "end": { "terminate": true name: MonitorVitals type: event exclusive: true onEvents: - eventRefs: - HighBodyTemperature actions: - functionRef: refName: sendTylenolOrder arguments: patientid: "${ .patientId }" - HighBloodPressure refName: callNurse - HighRespirationRate refName: callPulmonologist end: terminate: true Event states await one or more events and perform actions when they are received.If defined as the workflow starting state, the event state definition controls when the workflowinstances should be created. The exclusive property determines if the state should wait for any of the defined events in the onEvents array, orif all defined events must be present for their associated actions to be performed. Following two figures illustrate the exclusive property: If the Event state in this case is a workflow starting state, the occurrence of any of the defined events would start a new workflow instance. If the Event state in this case is a workflow starting state, the occurrence of all defined events would start a newworkflow instance. In order to consider only events that are related to each other, we need to set the correlation property in the workflowevents definitions. This allows us to set up event correlation rules against the eventsextension context attributes. If the Event state is not a workflow starting state, the timeout property can be used to define the time duration from theinvocation of the event state. If the defined event, or events have not been received during this time,the state should transition to the next state or can end the Workflow Execution (if it is an end state). The timeouts property can be used to define state specific timeout settings. Event states can define thestateExecTimeout, actionExecTimeout, and eventTimeout properties.For more information about Event state specific event timeout settings reference this section.For more information about workflow timeouts reference the Workflow Timeouts section. Note that transition and end properties are mutually exclusive, meaning that you cannot define both of them at the same time. OPERATION STATE actionMode Should actions be performed sequentially or in parallel. Default is sequential enum no actions Actions to be performed array yes stateDataFilter State data filter object no onErrors States error handling and retries definitions array no usedForCompensation If true, this state is used to compensate another state. Default is false boolean no "name": "RejectApplication", "type": "operation", "actionMode": "sequential", "actions": [ "refName": "sendRejectionEmailFunction", "customer": "${ .customer }" "end": true name: RejectApplication type: operation actionMode: sequential actions: - functionRef: refName: sendRejectionEmailFunction arguments: customer: "${ .customer }" end: true Operation state defines a set of actions to be performed in sequence or in parallel.Once all actions have been performed, a transition to another state can occur. The timeouts property can be used to define state specific timeout settings. Operation states can definethe stateExecTimeout and actionExecTimeout settings. For more information on Workflow timeouts referencethe Workflow Timeouts section. SWITCH STATE dataConditions Defined if the Switch state evaluates conditions and transitions based on state data. array yes (if eventConditions is not defined) eventConditions Defined if the Switch state evaluates conditions and transitions based on arrival of events. array yes (if dataConditions is not defined defaultCondition Default transition of the workflow if there is no matching data conditions or event timeout is reached. Can be a transition or end definition object yes "name":"CheckVisaStatus", "eventConditions": [ "eventRef": "visaApprovedEvent", "transition": "HandleApprovedVisa" "eventRef": "visaRejectedEvent", "transition": "HandleRejectedVisa" "timeouts": { "eventTimeout": "PT1H" "transition": "HandleNoVisaDecision" name: CheckVisaStatus type: switch eventConditions: - eventRef: visaApprovedEvent transition: HandleApprovedVisa - eventRef: visaRejectedEvent transition: HandleRejectedVisa timeouts: eventTimeout: PT1H defaultCondition: transition: HandleNoVisaDecision Switch states can be viewed as workflow gateways: they can direct transitions of a workflow based on certain conditions.There are two types of conditions for switch states: Data-based conditions Event-based conditions These are exclusive, meaning that a switch state can define one or the other condition type, but not both. At times multiple defined conditions can be evaluated to true by runtime implementations.Conditions defined first take precedence over conditions defined later. This is backed by the fact that arrays/sequencesare ordered in both JSON and YAML. For example, let's say there are two true conditions: A and B, defined in that order.Because A was defined first, its transition will be executed, not B's. In case of data-based conditions definition, switch state controls workflow transitions based on the states data.If no defined conditions can be matched, the state transitions is taken based on the defaultCondition property.This property can be either a transition to another workflow state, or an end definition meaning a workflow end. For event-based conditions, a switch state acts as a workflow wait state. It halts Workflow Executionuntil one of the referenced events arrive, then making a transition depending on that event definition.If events defined in event-based conditions do not arrive before the states eventTimeout property expires,state transitions are based on the defined defaultCondition property. The timeouts property can be used to define state specific timeout settings. Switch states can define thestateExecTimeout setting. If eventConditions is defined, the switch state can also define theeventTimeout property. For more information on workflow timeouts reference the Workflow Timeouts section. SLEEP STATE duration Duration (ISO 8601 duration format) to sleep. For example: "PT15M" (sleep 15 minutes), or "P2DT3H4M" (sleep 2 days, 3 hours and 4 minutes) string yes transition Next transition of the workflow after the sleep string or object yes (if end is not defined) "name": "SleepFiveSeconds", "type": "sleep", "duration": "PT5S", "transition": "GetJobStatus" name: SleepFiveSeconds type: sleep duration: PT5S transition: GetJobStatus Sleep statesuspends Workflow Execution for a given time duration. The delay is defined in its duration property using the ISO 8601duration format. PARALLEL STATE branches List of branches for this parallel state array yes completionType Option types on how to complete branch execution. Default is "allOf" enum no numCompleted Used when branchCompletionType is set to atLeast to specify the least number of branches that must complete in order for the state to transition/end. string or number yes (if completionType is atLeast) transition Next transition of the workflow after all branches have completed execution string or object yes (if end is not defined) { "name":"ParallelExec", "type":"parallel", "completionType": "allOf", "branches": [ "name": "Branch1", "actions": [ { "functionRef": { "refName": "functionNameOne", "arguments": { "order": "${ .someParam }" "name": "Branch2", { "functionRef": { "refName": "functionNameTwo", "arguments": { "order": "${ .someParam }" } } } ] "end": true name: ParallelExec type: parallel completionType: allOf branches: - name: Branch1 refName: functionNameOne order: "${ .someParam }" - name: Branch2 refName: functionNameTwo Parallel state defines a collection of branches that are executed in parallel.A parallel state can be seen a state which splits up the current workflow instance execution pathinto multiple ones, one for each branch. These execution paths are performed in paralleland are joined back into the current execution path depending on the defined completionType parameter value. The "completionType" enum specifies the different ways of completing branch execution: allOf: All branches must complete execution before the state can transition/end. This is the default value in case this parameter is not defined in the parallel state definition. atLeast: State can transition/end once at least the specified number of branches have completed execution. In this case you must alsospecify the numCompleted property to define this number. Exceptions may occur during execution of branches of the Parallel state, this is described in detail in this section. The timeouts property can be used to set state specific timeout settings. Parallel states can define thestateExecTimeout and branchExecTimeout timeout settings. For more information on workflow timeoutsreference the Workflow Timeouts section. INJECT STATE data JSON object which can be set as state's data input and can be manipulated via filter object yes transition Next transition of the workflow after injection has completed string or object yes (if end is not defined) "name":"Hello", "type":"inject", "data": { "result": "Hello" "transition": "World" name: Hello type: inject data: result: Hello transition: World Inject state can be used to inject static data into state data input. Inject state does not perform any actions.It is very useful for debugging, for example, as you can test/simulate Workflow Execution with pre-set data that would typicallybe dynamic in nature (e.g., function calls, events). The inject state data property allows you to statically define a JSON object which gets added to the states data input.You can use the filter property to control the states data output to the transition state. Here is a typical example of how to use the inject state to add static data into its states data input, which then is passedas data output to the transition state: "name":"SimpleInjectState", "type":"inject", "data": { "person": { "fname": "John", "lname": "Doe", "address": "1234 SomeStreet", "age": 40 }, "transition": "GreetPersonState" name: SimpleInjectState type: inject data: person: fname: John lname: Doe address: 1234 SomeStreet age: 40 transition: GreetPersonState The data output of the "SimpleInjectState" which then is passed as input to the transition state would be: "person": { If the inject state already receives a data input from the previous transition state, the inject data should be mergedwith its data input. You can also use the filter property to filter the state data after data is injected. Let's say we have: "name":"SimpleInjectState", "people": [ "fname": "John", "lname": "Doe", "address": "1234 SomeStreet", "age": 40 }, "fname": "Marry", "lname": "Allice", "age": 25 "fname": "Kelly", "lname": "Mill", "age": 30 "stateDataFilter": { "output": "${ {people: [.people[] | select(.age < 40)]} }" "transition": "GreetPersonState" people: - fname: John - fname: Marry lname: Allice age: 25 - fname: Kelly lname: Mill age: 30 stateDataFilter: output: "${ {people: [.people[] | select(.age < 40)]} }" In which case the states data output would include only people whose age is less than 40: "people": [ "fname": "Marry", "lname": "Allice", "age": 25 "fname": "Kelly", "lname": "Mill", "age": 30 You can change your output path easily during testing, for example change the expression to: ${ {people: [.people[] | select(.age >= 40)]} } This allows you to test if your workflow behaves properly for cases when there are people whose age is greater or equal 40. FOREACH STATE inputCollection Workflow expression selecting an array element of the states data string yes outputCollection Workflow expression specifying an array element of the states data to add the results of each iteration string no iterationParam Name of the iteration parameter that can be referenced in actions/workflow. For each parallel iteration, this param should contain an unique element of the inputCollection array string no batchSize Specifies how many iterations may run in parallel at the same time. Used if mode property is set to parallel (default). If not specified, its value should be the size of the inputCollection string or number no mode Specifies how iterations are to be performed (sequentially or in parallel). Default is parallel enum no actions Actions to be executed for each of the elements of inputCollection array yes transition Next transition of the workflow after state has completed string or object yes (if end is not defined) "name": "ProvisionOrdersState", "type": "foreach", "inputCollection": "${ .orders }", "iterationParam": "singleorder", "outputCollection": "${ .provisionresults }", "refName": "provisionOrderFunction", "order": "${ $singleorder }" name: ProvisionOrdersState type: foreach inputCollection: "${ .orders }" iterationParam: "singleorder" outputCollection: "${ .provisionresults }" refName: provisionOrderFunction order: "${ $singleorder }" ForEach states can be used to execute actions for each element of a data set. Each iteration of the ForEach state is by default executed in parallel by default.However, executing iterations sequentially is also possible by setting the value of the mode property tosequential. The mode property defines if iterations should be done sequentially or in parallel. By default,if mode is not specified, iterations should be done in parallel. If the default parallel iteration mode is used, the batchSize property to the number of iterations (batch)that can be executed at a time. To give an example, if the number of iterations is 55 and batchSizeis set to 10, 10 iterations are to be executed at a time, meaning that the state would execute 10 iterations in parallel,then execute the next batch of 10 iterations. After 5 such executions, the remaining 5 iterations are to be executed in the last batch.The batch size value must be greater than 1. If not specified, its value should be the size of the inputCollection (all iterations). The inputCollection property is a workflow expression which selects an array in the states data. All iterationsare performed against data elements of this array. If this array does not exist, the runtime should throwan error. This error can be handled inside the states onErrors definition. The outputCollection property is a workflow expression which selects an array in the state data where the resultsof each iteration should be added to. If this array does not exist, it should be created. The iterationParam property defines the name of the iteration parameter passed to each iteration of the ForEach state.It should contain the unique element of the inputCollection array and made available to actions of the ForEach state.iterationParam can be accessed as an expression variable. In JQ, expression variables are prefixed by $.If iterationParam is not explicitly defined, runtimes should create one and populate it with the value of the uniqueiteration parameter for each iteration of the ForEach state. The actions property defines actions to be executed in each state iteration. Let's take a look at an example: In this example the data input to our workflow is an array of orders: "orders": [ "orderNumber": "1234", "completed": true, "email": "firstBuyer@buyer.com" "orderNumber": "5678", "email": "secondBuyer@buyer.com" "orderNumber": "9910", "completed": false, "email": "thirdBuyer@buyer.com" and our workflow is defined as: "id": "sendConfirmWorkflow", "name": "SendConfirmationForCompletedOrders", "version": "1.0.0", "specVersion": "0.8", "start": "SendConfirmState", "name": "sendConfirmationFunction", "states": [ "type":"foreach", "inputCollection": "${ [.orders[] | select(.completed == true)] }", "iterationParam": "completedorder", "outputCollection": "${ .confirmationresults }", "functionRef": { "refName": "sendConfirmationFunction", "arguments": { "orderNumber": "${ $completedorder.orderNumber }", "email": "${ $completedorder.email }" } id: sendConfirmWorkflow name: SendConfirmationForCompletedOrders start: SendConfirmState functions: - name: sendConfirmationFunction operation: file://confirmationapi.json#sendOrderConfirmation states: - name: SendConfirmState type: foreach inputCollection: "${ [.orders[] | select(.completed == true)] }" iterationParam: completedorder outputCollection: "${ .confirmationresults }" refName: sendConfirmationFunction orderNumber: "${ $completedorder.orderNumber }" email: "${ $completedorder.email }" end: true The workflow data input containing order information is passed to the SendConfirmState ForEach state.The ForEach state defines an inputCollection property which selects all orders that have the completed property set to true. For each element of the array selected by inputCollection a JSON object defined by iterationParam should becreated containing an unique element of inputCollection and passed as the data input to the parallel executed actions. So for this example, we would have two parallel executions of the sendConfirmationFunction, the first one having data: "completedorder": { "orderNumber": "1234", "completed": true, "email": "firstBuyer@buyer.com" and the second: "orderNumber": "5678", "email": "secondBuyer@buyer.com" The results of each parallel action execution are stored as elements in the state data array defined by the outputCollection property. The timeouts property can be used to set state specific timeout settings. ForEach states can define thestateExecTimeout and actionExecTimeout settings. For more information on workflow timeouts reference the Workflow Timeoutssection. CALLBACK STATE action Defines the action to be executed object yes eventRef References an unique callback event name in the defined workflow events string yes eventDataFilter Callback event data filter definition object no transition Next transition of the workflow after callback event has been received string or object yes (if end is not defined) compensatedBy Uniaue name of a workflow state which is responsible for compensation of this state string no "name": "CheckCredit", "type": "callback", "action": { "refName": "callCreditCheckMicroservice", "eventRef": "CreditCheckCompletedEvent", "timeouts": { "stateExecTimeout": "PT15M" "transition": "EvaluateDecision" name: CheckCredit type: callback action: functionRef: refName: callCreditCheckMicroservice eventRef: CreditCheckCompletedEvent stateExecTimeout: PT15M transition: EvaluateDecision Serverless orchestration can at times require manual steps/decisions to be made. While some work performedin a serverless workflow can be executed automatically, some decisions must involve manual steps (e.g., human decisions).The Callback state allows you to explicitly model manual decision steps during Workflow Execution. The action property defines a function call that triggers an external activity/service. Once the action executes,the callback state will wait for a CloudEvent (defined via the eventRef property), which indicates the completionof the manual decision by the called service. Note that the called decision service is responsible for emitting the callback CloudEvent indicating the completion of thedecision and including the decision results as part of the event payload. This event must be correlated to theworkflow instance using the callback events context attribute defined in the correlation property of thereferenced Event Definition. Once the completion (callback) event is received, the Callback state completes its execution and transitions to the nextdefined workflow state or completes Workflow Execution in case it is an end state. The callback event payload is merged with the Callback state data and can be filtered via the "eventDataFilter" definition. If the defined callback event has not been received during this time period, the state should transition to the next state or end Workflow Execution if it is an end state. The timeouts property defines state specific timeout settings. Callback states can define thestateExecTimeout, actionExecTimeout, and eventTimeout properties.For more information on workflow timeouts reference the Workflow Timeoutssection. FUNCTION DEFINITION name Unique function name string yes operation If type is rest, #. If type is asyncapi, #. If type is rpc, ##. If type is graphql, #<literal "mutation" or "query">#. If type is odata, #. If type is expression, defines the workflow expression. string yes type Defines the function type. Can be either rest, asyncapi, rpc, graphql, odata, expression, or custom. Default is rest enum no authRef References an auth definition name to be used to access to resource defined in the operation parameter string no metadata Metadata information. Can be used to define custom function information object no "name": "HelloWorldFunction", "operation": "https://hellworldservice.api.com/api.json#helloWorld" name: HelloWorldFunction operation: https://hellworldservice.api.com/api.json#helloWorld The name property defines an unique name of the function definition. The type property defines the function type. Its value can be either rest or expression. Default value is rest. Depending on the function type, the operation property can be: If type is rest, a combination of the function/service OpenAPI definition document URI and the particular service operation that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'.For example https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json#getPetById. If type is asyncapi, a combination of the AsyncApi definition document URI and the particular service operation that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'.For example file://streetlightsapi.yaml#onLightMeasured. If type is rpc, a combination of the gRPC proto document URI and the particular service name and service method name that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'.For example file://myuserservice.proto#UserService#ListUsers. If type is graphql, a combination of the GraphQL schema definition URI and the particular service name and service method name that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'.For example file://myuserservice.proto#UserService#ListUsers. If type is odata, a combination of the GraphQL schema definition URI and the particular service name and service method name that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'.For example https://services.odata.org/V3/OData/OData.svc#Products. If type is expression, defines the expression syntax. Take a look at the workflow expressions section for more information on this. Defining custom function types is possible, for more information on that refer to the Defining custom function types section. The authRef property references a name of a defined workflow auth definition.It is used to provide authentication info to access the resource defined in the operation property and/or to invoke the function. The metadata property allows users to define custom information to function definitions.This allows you for example to define functions that describe of a command executions on a Docker image: - name: whalesayimage metadata: image: docker/whalesay command: cowsay Note that using metadata for cases such as above heavily reduces the portability of your workflow markup. Function definitions themselves do not define data input parameters. Parameters can bedefined via the parameters property in function definitions inside actions. AuthRef Definition resource References an auth definition to be used to access the resource defined in the operation parameter string yes invocation References an auth definition to be used to invoke the operation string no The authRef property references a name of a defined workflow auth definition. It can be a string or an object. If it's a string, the referenced auth definition is used solely for the function's invocation. If it's an object, it is possible to specify an auth definition to use for the function's resource retrieval (as defined by the operation property) and another for its invocation. Example of a function definition configured to use an auth definition called "My Basic Auth" upon invocation: - name: SecuredFunctionInvocation operation: https://test.com/swagger.json#HelloWorld authRef: My Basic Auth Example of a function definition configured to use an auth definition called "My Basic Auth" to retrieve the resource defined by the operation property, and an auth definition called "My OIDC Auth" upon invocation: authRef: resource: My Basic Auth invocation: My OIDC Auth Note that if multiple functions share the same operation path (which is the first component of the operation value, located before the first '#' character), and if one of them defines an auth definition for resource access, then it should always be used to access said resource.In other words, when retrieving the resource of the function "MySecuredFunction2" defined in the following example, the "My Api Key Auth" auth definition should be used, because the "MySecuredFunction1" has defined it for resource access.This is done to avoid unnecessary repetitions of auth definition configuration when using the same resource for multiple defined functions. - name: MySecuredFunction1 operation: https://secure.resources.com/myapi.json#helloWorld authRef: resource: My ApiKey Auth - name: MySecuredFunction2 operation: https://secure.resources.com/myapi.json#holaMundo It's worth noting that if an auth definition has been defined for an OpenAPI function which's resource declare an authentication mechanism, the later should be used instead, thus ignoring entirely the auth definition. EVENT DEFINITION name Unique event name string yes source CloudEvent source. If not set when kind is produced, runtimes are expected to use a default value, such as https://serverlessworkflow.io in order to comply with the CloudEvent spec constraints) string yes (if type is not defined. type CloudEvent type string yes (if source is not defined) kind Defines the event is either consumed or produced by the workflow. Default is consumed enum no correlation Define event correlation rules for this event. Only used for consumed events array no dataOnly If true (default value), only the Event payload is accessible to consuming Workflow states. If false, both event payload and context attributes should be accessible boolean no "name": "ApplicantInfo", "type": "org.application.info", "source": "applicationssource", "kind": "consumed", "correlation": [ "contextAttributeName": "applicantId" name: ApplicantInfo type: org.application.info source: applicationssource kind: consumed correlation: - contextAttributeName: applicantId Used to define events and their correlations. These events can be either consumed or produced during Workflow Execution as wellas can be used to trigger function/service invocations. The Serverless Workflow specification mandates that all events conform to the CloudEvents specification.This is to assure consistency and portability of the events format used. The name property defines a single name of the event that is unique inside the workflow definition. This event name can bethen referenced within function and state definitions. The source property matches this event definition with the sourceproperty of the CloudEvent required attributes. The type property matches this event definition with the type property of the CloudEvent required attributes. The kind property defines this event as either consumed or produced. In terms of the workflow, this means it is either an eventthat triggers workflow instance creation, or continuation of workflow instance execution (consumed), or an eventthat the workflow instance creates during its execution (produced).The default value (if not specified) of the kind property is consumed.Note that for produced event definitions, implementations must provide the value of the CloudEvent source attribute.In this case (i.e., when the kind property is set to produced), the source property of the event is not required in the workflow definition.Otherwise, (i.e., when the kind property is set to consumed), the source property must be defined in the event definition. Event correlation plays a big role in large event-driven applications. Correlating one or more events with a particular workflow instancecan be done by defining the event correlation rules within the correlation property.This property is an array of correlation definitions.The CloudEvents specification allows users to add Extension Context Attributesand the correlation definitions can use these attributes to define clear matching event correlation rules.Extension context attributes are not part of the event payload, so they are serialized the same way as other standard required attributes.This means that the event payload does not have to be inspected by implementations in order to read and evaluate the defined correlation rules. Let's take a look at an example. Here we have two events that have an extension context attribute called "patientId" (as well as "department", whichwill be used in further examples below): "specversion" : "1.0", "type" : "com.hospital.patient.heartRateMonitor", "source" : "hospitalMonitorSystem", "subject" : "HeartRateReading", "id" : "A234-1234-1234", "time" : "2020-01-05T17:31:00Z", "patientId" : "PID-12345", "department": "UrgentCare", "data" : { "value": "80bpm" and "type" : "com.hospital.patient.bloodPressureMonitor", "subject" : "BloodPressureReading", "id" : "B234-1234-1234", "time" : "2020-02-05T17:31:00Z", "value": "110/70" We can then define a correlation rule, through which all consumed events with the "hospitalMonitorSystem", and the "com.hospital.patient.heartRateMonitor"type that have the same value of the patientId property to be correlated to the created workflow instance: "events": [ "name": "HeartRateReadingEvent", "source": "hospitalMonitorSystem", "type": "com.hospital.patient.heartRateMonitor", "kind": "consumed", "correlation": [ "contextAttributeName": "patientId" If a workflow instance is created (e.g., via Event state) by consuming a "HeartRateReadingEvent" event, all other consumed eventsfrom the defined source and with the defined type that have the same "patientId" as the event that triggered the workflow instanceshould then also be associated with the same instance. You can also correlate multiple events together. In the following example, we assume that the workflow consumes two different event types,and we want to make sure that both are correlated, as in the above example, with the same "patientId": "name": "BloodPressureReadingEvent", "source": "hospitalMonitorSystem", "type": "com.hospital.patient.bloodPressureMonitor", "contextAttributeName": "patientId" Event correlation can be based on equality (values of the defined "contextAttributeName" must be equal), but it can also be basedon comparing it to custom defined values (string, or expression). For example: "contextAttributeName": "department", "contextAttributeValue" : "UrgentCare" In this example, we have two correlation rules defined: The first one is on the "patientId" CloudEvent context attribute, meaning again thatall consumed events from this source and type must have the same "patientId" to be considered. The second rulesays that these events must all have a context attribute named "department" with the value of "UrgentCare". This allows developers to write orchestration workflows that are specifically targeted to patients that are in the hospital urgent care unit,for example. The dataOnly property deals with what Event data is accessible by the consuming Workflow states.If its value is true (default value), only the Event payload is accessible to consuming Workflow states.If false, both Event payload and context attributes should be accessible. AUTH DEFINITION Auth definitions can be used to define authentication information that should be applied to function definitions.It can be used for both the retrieval of the function's resource (as defined by the operation property) and for the function's invocation. name Unique auth definition name string yes scheme Auth scheme, can be "basic", "bearer", or "oauth2". Default is "basic" enum no properties Auth scheme properties. Can be one of "Basic properties definition", "Bearer properties definition", or "OAuth2 properties definition" object yes The name property defines the unique auth definition name.The scheme property defines the auth scheme to be used. Can be "bearer", "basic" or "oauth2".The properties property defines the auth scheme properties information.Can be one of "Basic properties definition", "Bearer properties definition", or "OAuth2 properties definition" See here for more information about Basic Authentication scheme. The Basic properties definition can have two types, either string or object.If string type, it defines a workflow expression that contains all needed Basic auth information.If object type, it has the following properties: username String or a workflow expression. Contains the user name string yes password String or a workflow expression. Contains the user password string yes See here for more information about Bearer Authentication scheme. token String or a workflow expression. Contains the token information string yes See here for more information about OAuth2 Authentication scheme. authority String or a workflow expression. Contains the authority information string no grantType Defines the grant type. Can be "password", "clientCredentials", or "tokenExchange" enum yes clientId String or a workflow expression. Contains the client identifier string yes clientSecret Workflow secret or a workflow expression. Contains the client secret string no scopes Array containing strings or workflow expressions. Contains the OAuth2 scopes array no username String or a workflow expression. Contains the user name. Used only if grantType is 'resourceOwner' string no password String or a workflow expression. Contains the user password. Used only if grantType is 'resourceOwner' string no audiences Array containing strings or workflow expressions. Contains the OAuth2 audiences array no subjectToken String or a workflow expression. Contains the subject token string no requestedSubject String or a workflow expression. Contains the requested subject string no requestedIssuer String or a workflow expression. Contains the requested issuer string no CORRELATION DEFINITION contextAttributeName CloudEvent Extension Context Attribute name string yes contextAttributeValue CloudEvent Extension Context Attribute value string no "contextAttributeName": "department", "contextAttributeValue" : "UrgentCare" - contextAttributeName: patientId - contextAttributeName: department contextAttributeValue: UrgentCare Used to define event correlation rules. Only usable for consumed event definitions. The contextAttributeName property defines the name of the CloudEvent extension context attribute.The contextAttributeValue property defines the value of the defined CloudEvent extension context attribute. ONEVENTS DEFINITION eventRefs References one or more unique event names in the defined workflow events array yes actionMode Specifies how actions are to be performed (in sequence or in parallel). Default is sequential enum no actions Actions to be performed array no eventDataFilter Event data filter definition object no "eventRefs": ["HighBodyTemperature"], "actions": [{ "refName": "sendTylenolOrder", "patientid": "${ .patientId }" eventRefs: - HighBodyTemperature refName: sendTylenolOrder patientid: "${ .patientId }" OnEvent definition allow you to define which actions are to be performedfor the one or more events definitions defined in the eventRefs array.Note that the values of eventRefs array must be unique. The actionMode property defines if the defined actions need to be performed sequentially or in parallel. The actions property defines a list of actions to be performed. When specifying the onEvents definition it is important to consider the Event states exclusive property,because it determines how 'onEvents' is interpreted.Let's look at the following JSON definition of 'onEvents' to show this: "onEvents": [{ "eventRefs": ["HighBodyTemperature", "HighBloodPressure"], "refName": "SendTylenolOrder", "patient": "${ .patientId }" "refName": "CallNurse", Depending on the value of the Event states exclusive property, this definition can mean two different things: If exclusive is set to true, the consumption of either the HighBodyTemperature or HighBloodPressure events will trigger action execution. If exclusive is set to false, the consumption of both the HighBodyTemperature and HighBloodPressure events will trigger action execution. This is visualized in the diagram below: ACTION DEFINITION name Unique Action name string no functionRef References a reusable function definition object or string yes (if eventRef & subFlowRef are not defined) eventRef References a produce and consume reusable event definitions object yes (if functionRef & subFlowRef are not defined) subFlowRef References a workflow to be invoked object or string yes (if eventRef & functionRef are not defined) retryRef References a defined workflow retry definition. If not defined uses the default runtime retry definition string no nonRetryableErrors List of references to defined workflow errors for which the action should not be retried. Used only when autoRetries is set to true array no retryableErrors List of references to defined workflow errors for which the action should be retried. Used only when autoRetries is set to false array no actionDataFilter Action data filter definition object no sleep Defines time periods Workflow Execution should sleep before / after function execution object no condition Expression, if defined, must evaluate to true for this action to be performed. If false, action is disregarded string no "name": "Finalize Application Action", "functionRef": { "refName": "finalizeApplicationFunction", "arguments": { "applicantid": "${ .applicantId }" name: Finalize Application Action functionRef: refName: finalizeApplicationFunction arguments: applicantid: "${ .applicantId }" Actions specify invocations of services or other workflows during Workflow Execution.Service invocation can be done in three different ways: Reference functions definitions by its unique name using the functionRef property. Reference a produced and consumed event definitions via the eventRef property. Reference a sub-workflow invocation via the subFlowRef property. Note that functionRef, eventRef, and subFlowRef are mutually exclusive, meaning that only one of them can bespecified in a single action definition. The name property specifies the action name. In the event-based scenario a service, or a set of services we want to invokeare not exposed via a specific resource URI for example, but can only be invoked via an event.The eventRef property defines thereferenced produced event via its produceEventRef property and a consumed event via its consumeEventRef property. The sleep property can be used to define time periods that Workflow Execution should sleepbefore and/or after function execution. It can have two properties: before - defines the amount of time (ISO 8601 duration format) to sleep before function invocation. after - defines the amount of time (ISO 8601 duration format) to sleep after function invocation. Function invocation timeouts should be handled via the states timeouts definition. The retryRef property references one of the defined workflow retries by it's unique name. If not set, the actionshould be retried according to the default retry policy of the runtime implementation. For more information about workflowretries reference this section. The nonRetryableErrors property is a list that references one or more unique names of workflow error definitions.This is the list of known errors for which the action should not be retried for.It should be used only when the workflow top-level autoRetries property is set to true. The retryableErrors property is a list that references one or more unique names of workflow error definitions.This is the list of known errors for which the action should be retried for.It should be used only when the workflow top-level autoRetries property is set to false. The condition property is a workflow expression. If defined, it must evaluate to truefor this action to be performed. If it evaluates to false the action is skipped.If the condition property is not defined, the action is always performed. SUBFLOW ACTION Often you want to group your workflows into small logical units that solve a particular business problem and can be reused inmultiple other workflow definitions. Reusable workflows are referenced by their id property via the SubFlow action workflowId parameter. For the simple case, subFlowRef can be a string containing the id of the sub-workflow to invoke.If you want to specify other parameters then a subFlowRef should be provided instead. Each referenced workflow receives the SubFlow actions data as workflow data input. Referenced sub-workflows must declare their own function and event definitions. FUNCTIONREF DEFINITION FunctionRef definition can have two types, either string or object.If string type, it defines the name of the referenced function.This can be used as a short-cut definition when you don't need to define any other parameters, for example: "functionRef": "myFunction" Note that if used with string type, the invocation of the function is synchronous. If you need to define parameters in your functionRef definition, you can defineit with its object type which has the following properties: refName Name of the referenced function string yes arguments Arguments (inputs) to be passed to the referenced function object yes (if function type is graphql, otherwise no) selectionSet Used if function type is graphql. String containing a valid GraphQL selection set string yes (if function type is graphql, otherwise no) invoke Specifies if the function should be invoked sync or async. Default is sync enum no "refName": "finalizeApplicationFunction", "arguments": { "applicantid": "${ .applicantId }" refName: finalizeApplicationFunction arguments: applicantid: "${ .applicantId }" The refName property is the name of the referenced function. The arguments property defines the arguments that are to be passed to the referenced function.Here is an example of using the arguments property: "refName": "checkFundsAvailabe", "arguments": { "account": { "id": "${ .accountId }" "forAmount": "${ .payment.amount }", "insufficientMessage": "The requested amount is not available." The invoke property defines how the function is invoked (sync or async). Default value of this property issync, meaning that Workflow Execution should wait until the function completes.If set to async, Workflow Execution should just invoke the function and should not wait until its completion.Note that in this case the action does not produce any results and the associated actions actionDataFilter as well asits retry definition, if defined, should be ignored.In addition, functions that are invoked async do not propagate their errors to the associated action definition and theworkflow state, meaning that any errors that happen during their execution cannot be handled in the workflow statesonErrors definition. Note that errors raised during functions that are invoked async should not fail Workflow Execution. EVENTREF DEFINITION Allows defining invocation of a function via event. produceEventRef Reference to the unique name of a produced event definition string yes consumeEventRef Reference to the unique name of a consumed event definition string no consumeEventTimeout Maximum amount of time (ISO 8601 format) to wait for the consume event. If not defined it be set to the actionExecutionTimeout string no data If string type, an expression which selects parts of the states data output to become the data (payload) of the event referenced by produceEventRef. If object type, a custom object to become the data (payload) of the event referenced by produceEventRef. string or object no contextAttributes Add additional event extension context attributes to the trigger/produced event object no "eventRef": { "produceEventRef": "MakeVetAppointment", "data": "${ .patientInfo }", "consumeEventRef": "VetAppointmentInfo" eventRef: produceEventRef: MakeVetAppointment data: "${ .patientInfo }" consumeEventRef: VetAppointmentInfo References a produced and consumed event definitions via the produceEventRef and consumeEventRef properties, respectively. The data property can have two types: string or object. If it is of string type, it is an expression that can select parts of state datato be used as payload of the event referenced by produceEventRef. If it is of object type, you can define a custom object to be the event payload. The contextAttributes property allows you to add one or more extension context attributesto the trigger/produced event. The consumeEventTimeout property defines the maximum amount of time (ISO 8601 format) to wait for the result event. If not defined it should default to the actionExecutionTimeout.If the event defined by the consumeEventRef property is not received in that set time, action invocation should raise an errorthat can be handled in the states onErrors definition. In case the consumeEventRef is not defined, the consumeEventTimeout property is ignored. The invoke property defines how the function is invoked (sync or async). Default value of this property issync, meaning that Workflow Execution should wait until the function completes (the result event is received).If set to async, Workflow Execution should just produce the trigger event and should not wait for the result event.Note that in this case the action does not produce any results (payload of the result event) and the associated actions eventDataFilter as well asits retry definition, if defined, should be ignored.Functions that are invoked via events (sync or async) do not propagate their errors to the associated action definition and theworkflow state, meaning that any errors that happen during their execution cannot be handled in the workflow statesonErrors definition. Note that errors raised during functions that are invoked sync or async in this caseshould not fail Workflow Execution. SUBFLOWREF DEFINITION SubFlowRef definition can have two types, namely string or object. If string type, it defines the unique id of the sub-workflow to be invoked.This short-hand definition can be used if sub-workflow lookup is done only by its idproperty and not its version property. "subFlowRef": "mySubFlowId" If you need to define the version properties, you can use its object type: workflowId Sub-workflow unique id string yes version Sub-workflow version string no invoke Specifies if the subflow should be invoked sync or async. Default is sync enum no onParentComplete If invoke is async, specifies if subflow execution should terminate or continue when parent workflow completes. Default is terminate enum no "workflowId": "handleApprovedVisaWorkflowID", "version": "2.0.0" workflowId: handleApprovedVisaWorkflowID version: '2.0.0' The workflowId property define the unique ID of the sub-workflow to be invoked.Usually, the workflow id should not be the same id of the workflow where the action is defined. Otherwise, it may occur undesired recurring calls to the same workflow. The version property defined the unique version of the sub-workflow to be invoked.If this property is defined, runtimes should match both the id and the version propertiesdefined in the sub-workflow definition. The invoke property defines how the subflow is invoked (sync or async). Default value of this property issync, meaning that Workflow Execution should wait until the subflow completes.If set to async, Workflow Execution should just invoke the subflow and not wait for its results.Note that in this case the action does not produce any results, and the associated actions actionDataFilter as well asits retry definition, if defined, should be ignored.Subflows that are invoked async do not propagate their errors to the associated action definition and theworkflow state, meaning that any errors that happen during their execution cannot be handled in the workflow statesonErrors definition. Note that errors raised during subflows that are invoked asyncshould not fail Workflow Execution. The onParentComplete property defines how subflow execution that is invoked async should behave if the parent workflowcompletes execution before the subflow completes its own execution.The default value of this property is terminate, meaning that if the parent workflow (the workflow that invoked the subflow)completes, execution of the subflow should be terminated.If it is set to continue, if the parent workflow completes, the subflow execution is allowed to continue its own execution. ERROR DEFINITION errorRef or errorRefs Reference one unique workflow error definition, or multiple unique workflow error definitions string (errorRef) or array (errorRefs) yes transition Transition to next state to handle the error string or object yes (if end is not defined) end End Workflow Execution if this error is encountered boolean or object yes (if transition is not defined) "errorRef": "Item not in inventory", "transition": "IssueRefundToCustomer" errorRef: Item not in inventory transition: IssueRefundToCustomer Error definitions describe checked errors that can occur during Workflow Execution and how to handle them. The errorRef property references the unique workflow error definition. For more info on workflow error handlingreferece this section. The errorRefsproperty references at least one of the defined workflow error definitions.Can be used when errorRef is not used. Usable when you want to define multiple error refs for which the same transitionor end definition should be applied.For more info on workflow error handlingreferece this section. Note that the errorRef and errorRefs properties are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can only specify one or the other,but not both at the same time. The transition property defines the transition to the next workflow state in cases when the definederror happens during runtime execution. If transition is not defined you can also define the end property which will end Workflow Execution at that point.Note that the transition and end properties are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can only specify one or the other,but not both at the same time. For more information, see the Workflow Error Handling sections. RETRY DEFINITION name Unique retry strategy name string yes delay Time delay between retry attempts (ISO 8601 duration format) string no maxAttempts Maximum number of retry attempts. Value of 1 means no retries are performed string or number yes maxDelay Maximum amount of delay between retry attempts (ISO 8601 duration format) string no increment Static duration which will be added to the delay between successive retries (ISO 8601 duration format) string no multiplier Float value by which the delay is multiplied before each attempt. For example: "1.2" meaning that each successive delay is 20% longer than the previous delay. For example, if delay is 'PT10S', then the delay between the first and second attempts will be 10 seconds, and the delay before the third attempt will be 12 seconds. float or string no jitter If float type, maximum amount of random time added or subtracted from the delay between each retry relative to total delay (between 0.0 and 1.0). If string type, absolute maximum amount of random time added or subtracted from the delay between each retry (ISO 8601 duration format) float or string no "name": "TimeoutRetryStrat", "delay": "PT2M", "maxAttempts": 3, "jitter": "PT0.001S" name: TimeoutRetryStrat delay: PT2M maxAttempts: 3 jitter: PT0.001S Defines the states retry policy (strategy). This is an explicit definition and can be reused across multipledefined state actions. The name property specifies the unique name of the retry definition (strategy). This unique namecan be referred by workflow states error definitions. The delay property specifies the initial time delay between retry attempts (ISO 8601 duration format). The increment property specifies a static duration which will be added to the delay between successive retries.To explain this better, let's say we have the following retry definition: "name": "Timeout Errors Strategy", "delay": "PT10S", "increment": "PT2S", "maxAttempts": 4 which means that we will retry up to 4 times after waiting with increasing delay between attempts;in this example 10, 12, 14, and 16 seconds between retries. The multiplier property specifies the value by which the interval time is increased for each of the retry attempts.To explain this better, let's say we have the following retry definition: "multiplier": 2, which means that we will retry up to 4 times after waiting with increasing delay between attempts;in this example 10, 20, 40, and 80 seconds between retries. If both increment and multiplier properties are defined, increment should be applied first and thenthe multiplier when determining the next retry time. The maxAttempts property determines the maximum number of retry attempts allowed and is a positive integer value. The jitter property is important to prevent certain scenarios where clientsare retrying in sync, possibly causing or contributing to a transient failureprecisely because they're retrying at the same time. Adding a typically small,bounded random amount of time to the period between retries serves the purposeof attempting to prevent these retries from happening simultaneously, possiblyreducing total time to complete requests and overall congestion. How this valueis used in the exponential backoff algorithm is left up to implementations. jitter may be specified as a percentage relative to the total delay.Once the next retry attempt delay is calculated, we can apply jitter as a percentage value relative to thiscalculated delay. For example, if your calculated delay for the next retry is six seconds, and we specifya jitter value of 0.3, a random amount of time between 0 and 1.8 (0.3 times 6) is to be added or subtractedfrom the calculated delay. Alternatively, jitter may be defined as an absolute value specified as an ISO8601 duration. This way, the maximum amount of random time added is fixed andwill not increase as new attempts are made. The maxDelay property determines the maximum amount of delay that is desired between retry attempts, and is appliedafter increment, multiplier, and jitter. To explain this better, let's say we have the following retry definition: "maxDelay": "PT100S", "multiplier": 4, "jitter": "PT1S", which means that we will retry up to 4 times after waiting with increasing delay between attempts;in this example we might observe the following series of delays: 11s (min(maxDelay, (delay +/- rand(jitter)) => min(100, 10 + 1)) 43s (min(maxDelay, (11s * multiplier) +/- rand(jitter)) => min(100, (11 * 4) - 1)) 100s (min(maxDelay, (43s * multiplier) +/- rand(jitter)) => min(100, (43 * 4) + 0)) 100s (min(maxDelay, (100s * multiplier) +/- rand(jitter)) => min(100, (100 * 4) - 1)) TRANSITION DEFINITION Transition definition can have two types, either string or object.If string, it defines the name of the state to transition to.This can be used as a short-cut definition when you don't need to define any other parameters, for example: "transition": "myNextState" If you need to define additional parameters in your transition definition, you can defineit with its object type which has the following properties: nextState Name of the state to transition to next string yes compensate If set to true, triggers workflow compensation before this transition is taken. Default is false boolean no produceEvents Array of producedEvent definitions. Events to be produced before the transition takes place array no "produceEvents": [{ "eventRef": "produceResultEvent", "data": "${ .result.data }" }], "nextState": "EvalResultState" produceEvents: - eventRef: produceResultEvent data: "${ .result.data }" nextState: EvalResultState The nextState property defines the name of the state to transition to next.The compensate property allows you to trigger compensation before the transition (if set to true).The produceEvents property allows you to define a list of events to produce before the transition happens. Transitions allow you to move from one state (control-logic block) to another. For more information see theTransitions section section. SWITCH STATE DATA CONDITIONS name Data condition name string no condition Workflow expression evaluated against state data. Must evaluate to true or false string yes transition Transition to another state if condition is true string or object yes (if end is not defined) end End Workflow Execution if condition is true boolean or object yes (if transition is not defined) "name": "Eighteen or older", "condition": "${ .applicant | .age >= 18 }", "transition": "StartApplication" name: Eighteen or older condition: "${ .applicant | .age >= 18 }" transition: StartApplication Switch state data conditions specify a data-based condition statement, which causes a transition to anotherworkflow state if evaluated to true.The condition property of the condition defines an expression (e.g., ${ .applicant | .age > 18 }), which selectsparts of the state data input. The condition must evaluate to true or false. If the condition is evaluated to true, you can specify either the transition or end definitionsto decide what to do, transition to another workflow state, or end Workflow Execution. Note that transition and enddefinitions are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can specify either one or the other, but not both. SWITCH STATE EVENT CONDITIONS name Event condition name string no eventRef References an unique event name in the defined workflow events string yes "name": "Visa approved", "eventRef": "visaApprovedEvent", "transition": "HandleApprovedVisa" name: Visa approved eventRef: visaApprovedEvent transition: HandleApprovedVisa Switch state event conditions specify events, which the switch state must wait for. Each conditioncan reference one workflow-defined event. Upon arrival of this event, the associated transition is taken.The eventRef property references a name of one of the defined workflow events. If the referenced event is received, you can specify either the transition or end definitionsto decide what to do, transition to another workflow state, or end Workflow Execution. The eventDataFilter property can be used to filter event data when it is received. Note that transition and enddefinitions are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can specify either one or the other, but not both. PARALLEL STATE BRANCH name Branch name string yes actions Actions to be executed in this branch array yes timeouts Branch specific timeout settings object no "name": "Branch1", "functionRef": { "refName": "functionNameOne", "arguments": { "order": "${ .someParam }" "refName": "functionNameTwo", "order": "${ .someParamTwo }" name: Branch1 refName: functionNameOne order: "${ .someParam }" refName: functionNameTwo order: "${ .someParamTwo }" Each branch receives the same copy of the Parallel state's data input. A branch can define actions that need to be executed. For the SubFlowRef action, the workflow id should not be the same id of the workflow where the branch is defined. Otherwise, it may occur undesired recurring calls to the same workflow. The timeouts property can be used to set branch specific timeout settings. Parallel state branches can set theactionExecTimeout and branchExecTimeout timeout properties. For more information on workflow timeouts reference theWorkflow Timeouts section. PARALLEL STATE HANDLING EXCEPTIONS Exceptions can occur during execution of Parallel state branches. By default, exceptions that are not handled within branches stop branch execution and are propagatedto the Parallel state and should be handled with its onErrors definition. If the parallel states branch defines actions, all exceptions that arise from executing these actions (after allallotted retries are exhausted)are propagated to the parallel stateand can be handled with the parallel states onErrors definition. If the parallel states defines a subflow action, exceptions that occur during execution of the called workflowcan choose to handle exceptions on their own. All unhandled exceptions from the called workflowexecution however are propagated back to the parallel state and can be handled with the parallel statesonErrors definition. Note that once an error that is propagated to the parallel state from a branch and handled by thestates onErrors definition is handled (its associated transition is taken) no further errors from branches of thisparallel state should be considered as the workflow control flow logic has already moved to a different state. START DEFINITION Can be either string or object type. If type string, it defines the name of the workflow starting state. "start": "MyStartingState" In this case it's assumed that the schedule property is not defined. If the start definition is of type object, it has the following structure: stateName Name of the starting workflow state string no schedule Define the recurring time intervals or cron expressions at which workflow instances should be automatically started. string or object yes "stateName": "MyStartingstate", "schedule": "2020-03-20T09:00:00Z/PT2H" stateName: MyStartingstate schedule: 2020-03-20T09:00:00Z/PT2H Start definition explicitly defines how/when workflow instances should be created and what the workflow starting state is. The start definition can be either string or object type. If string type, it defines the name of the workflow starting state. If object type, it provides the ability to set the workflow starting state name, as well as the schedule property. The stateName property can be set to define the starting workflow state. If not specified, the first statein the workflow states definition should be used as the starting workflow state. The schedule property allows to define scheduled workflow instance creation.Scheduled starts have two different choices. You can define a recurring time interval or cron-based schedule at which a workflowinstance should be created (automatically). You can also define cron-based scheduled starts, which allows you to specify periodically started workflow instances based on a cron definition.Cron-based scheduled starts can handle absolute time intervals (i.e., not calculated in respect to some particular point in time).One use case for cron-based scheduled starts is a workflow that performs periodical data batch processing.In this case we could use a cron definition 0 0/5 * * * ? to define that a workflow instance from the workflow definition should be created every 5 minutes, starting at full hour. Here are some more examples of cron expressions and their meanings: * * * * * - Create workflow instance at the top of every minute 0 * * * * - Create workflow instance at the top of every hour 0 */2 * * * - Create workflow instance every 2 hours 0 9 8 * * - Create workflow instance at 9:00:00AM on the eighth day of every month See here to get more information on defining cron expressions. One thing to discuss when dealing with cron-based scheduled starts is when the workflow starting state is an Event.Event states define that workflow instances are triggered by the existence of the defined event(s).Defining a cron-based scheduled starts for the runtime implementations would mean that there needs to be an event service that issuesthe needed events at the defined times to trigger workflow instance creation. Defining a start definition is not required. If it's not defined, the starting workflowstate has to be the very first state defined in the workflow states array. SCHEDULE DEFINITION Schedule definition can have two types, either string or object.If string type, it defines time interval describing when the workflow instance should be automatically created.This can be used as a short-cut definition when you don't need to define any other parameters, for example: "schedule": "R/PT2H" If you need to define the cron or the timezone parameters in your schedule definition, you can defineit with its object type which has the following properties: interval A recurring time interval expressed in the derivative of ISO 8601 format specified below. Declares that workflow instances should be automatically created at the start of each time interval in the series. string yes (if cron is not defined) cron Cron expression defining when workflow instances should be automatically created object yes (if interval is not defined) timezone Timezone name used to evaluate the interval & cron-expression. If the interval specifies a date-time w/ timezone then proper timezone conversion will be applied. (default: UTC). string no "cron": "0 0/15 * * * ?" cron: 0 0/15 * * * ? The interval property uses a derivative of ISO 8601 recurring time interval format to describe a series of consecutive time intervals for workflow instances to be automatically created at the start of. Unlike full ISO 8601, this derivative format does not allow expression of an explicit number of recurrences or identification of a series by the date and time at the start and end of its first time interval.There are three ways to express a recurring interval: R/<Start>/<Duration>: Defines the start time and a duration, for example: "R/2020-03-20T13:00:00Z/PT2H", meaning workflowinstances will be automatically created every 2 hours starting from March 20th 2020 at 1pm UTC. R/<Duration>/<End>: Defines a duration and an end, for example: "R/PT2H/2020-05-11T15:30:00Z", meaning that workflow instances will beautomatically created every 2 hours until until May 11th 2020 at 3:30pm UTC (i.e., the last instance will be created 2 hours prior to that, at 1:30pm UTC). R/<Duration>: Defines a duration only, for example: "R/PT2H", meaning workflow instances will be automatically created every 2 hours. The start time of the first interval may be indeterminate, but should be delayed by no more than the specified duration and must repeat on schedule after that (this is effectively supplying the start time "out-of-band" as permitted ISO ISO 8601-1:2019 section 5.6.1 NOTE 1). Each runtime implementation should document how the start time for a duration-only interval is established. The cron property uses a cron expressionto describe a repeating interval upon which a workflow instance should be created automatically.For more information see the cron definition section. The timezone property is used to define a time zone name to evaluate the cron or interval expression against. If not specified, it should defaultto UTC time zone. See here for a list of timezone names. For ISO 8601 date timevalues in interval or cron.validUntil, runtimes should treat timezone as the 'local time' (UTC if timezone is not defined by the user). Note that when the workflow starting state is an Eventdefining cron-based scheduled starts for the runtime implementations would mean that there needs to be an event service that issuesthe needed events at the defined times to trigger workflow instance creation. CRON DEFINITION Cron definition can have two types, either string or object.If string type, it defines the cron expression describing when the workflow instance should be created (automatically).This can be used as a short-cut definition when you don't need to define any other parameters, for example: "cron": "0 15,30,45 * ? * *" If you need to define the validUntil parameters in your cron definition, you can defineit with its object type which has the following properties: expression Cron expression describing when the workflow instance should be created (automatically) string yes validUntil Specific date and time (ISO 8601 format) when the cron expression is no longer valid string no "expression": "0 15,30,45 * ? * *", "validUntil": "2021-11-05T08:15:30-05:00" expression: 0 15,30,45 * ? * * validUntil: '2021-11-05T08:15:30-05:00' The expression property is a a cron expression which defineswhen workflow instances should be created (automatically). The validUntil property defines a date and time (using ISO 8601 format). When thevalidUntil time is reached, the cron expression for instances creations of this workflowshould no longer be valid. For example let's say we have to following cron definitions: This tells the runtime engine to create an instance of this workflow every hourat minutes 15, 30 and 45. This is to be done until November 5, 2021, 8:15:30 am, US Eastern Standard Timeas defined by the validUntil property value. END DEFINITION Can be either boolean or object type. If type boolean, must be set to true, for example: "end": true In this case it's assumed that the terminate property has its default value of false, and the produceEvents,compensate, and continueAs properties are not defined. If the end definition is of type object, it has the following structure: terminate If true. terminates workflow instance execution boolean no produceEvents Array of producedEvent definitions. Defines events that should be produced. array no compensate If set to true, triggers workflow compensation before Workflow Execution completes. Default is false boolean no continueAs Defines that current Workflow Execution should stop, and execution should continue as a new workflow instance of the provided id string or object no "terminate": true, "produceEvents": [{ "eventRef": "provisioningCompleteEvent", "data": "${ .provisionedOrders }" terminate: true - eventRef: provisioningCompleteEvent data: "${ .provisionedOrders }" End definitions are used to explicitly define execution completion of a workflow instance or Workflow Execution path.A workflow definition must include at least one workflow state.Note that Switch states cannot declare to be workflow end states. Their conditions however candefine a stop of Workflow Execution. The terminate property, if set to true, completes the workflow instance execution, this any other activeexecution paths.If a terminate end is reached inside a ForEach or Parallel state the entire workflow instance is terminated. The produceEvents allows defining events which should be producedby the workflow instance before workflow stops its execution. It's important to mention that if the workflow keepActive property is set totrue,the only way to complete execution of the workflow instanceis if Workflow Execution reaches a state that defines an end definition with terminate property set to true,or, if the workflowExecTimeout property is defined, the time defined in its intervalis reached. The compensate property defines that workflow compensation should be performed before the workflowexecution is completed. The continueAs property defines that the current workflow instance should stop its execution,and worklow execution should continue as a new instance of a new workflow.When defined, it should be assumed that terminate is true. If continueAs is defined, and terminate is explicitlyset to false, runtimes should report this to users. Producing events, and compensation should still be performed (if defined)before the Workflow Execution is stopped, and continued as a new workflow instance with the defined workflow id. PRODUCEDEVENT DEFINITION eventRef Reference to a defined unique event name in the events definition string yes data If string type, an expression which selects parts of the states data output to become the data (payload) of the produced event. If object type, a custom object to become the data (payload) of produced event. string or object no contextAttributes Add additional event extension context attributes object no "eventRef": "provisioningCompleteEvent", "data": "${ .provisionedOrders }", "contextAttributes": [{ "buyerId": "${ .buyerId }" }] eventRef: provisioningCompleteEvent data: "${ .provisionedOrders }" contextAttributes: - buyerId: "${ .buyerId }" Defines the event (CloudEvent format) to be produced when Workflow Execution completes or during a workflow transitions.The eventRef property must match the name ofone of the defined produced events in the events definition. The data property can have two types, object or string. If of string type, it is an expression that can select parts of state datato be used as the event payload. If of object type, you can define a custom object to be the event payload. The contextAttributes property allows you to add one or more extension context attributesto the generated event. Being able to produce events when Workflow Execution completes or during state transitionallows for event-based orchestration communication.For example, completion of an orchestration workflow can notify other orchestration workflows to decide if they need to act uponthe produced event, or notify monitoring services of the current state of Workflow Execution, etc.It can be used to create very dynamic orchestration scenarios. TRANSITIONS Serverless workflow states can have one or more incoming and outgoing transitions (from/to other states).Each state can define a transition definition that is used to determine whichstate to transition to next. Implementers must use the unique State name property for determining the transition. Events can be produced during state transitions. The produceEvents property of the transition definitions allows youto reference one or more defined produced events in the workflow events definitions.For each of the produced events you can select what parts of state data to be the event payload. Transitions can trigger compensation via their compensate property. See the Workflow Compensationsection for more information. ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES Specifying additional properties, namely properties which are not defined by the specificationare only allowed in the Workflow Definition.Additional properties serve the same purpose as Workflow Metadata.They allow you to enrich the workflow definition with custom information. Additional properties, just like workflow metadata, should not affect Workflow Execution.Implementations may choose to use additional properties or ignore them. It is recommended to use workflow metadata instead of additional properties in the workflow definition. Let's take a look at an example of additional properties: "id": "myworkflow", "name": "My Test Workflow", "start": "My First State", "loglevel": "Info", "environment": "Production", "category": "Sales", "states": [ ... ] In this example, we specify the loglevel, environment, and category additional properties. Note the same can be also specified using workflow metadata, which is the preferred approach: "name": "Py Test Workflow", "metadata": { "loglevel": "Info", "environment": "Production", "category": "Sales" Serverless Workflow language allows you to define explicit error handling, meaning you can define what should happenin case of errors inside your workflow model rather than some generic error handling entity.This allows error handling to become part of your orchestration activities and as such part of your business problemsolutions. The idea behind the way Serverless Workflow defines error handling is that workflows should only fail due to unknown bugsduring execution. In general, you should always write your workflows so that they do not fail on any known failures. Each workflow state can define error handling, which is related only to errors that may arise during itsexecution. Error handling defined in one state cannot be used to handle errors that happened during execution of another stateduring Workflow Execution. Unknown errors that may arise during workflow state execution that are not explicitly handled within the workflow definitionshould be reported by runtime implementations and halt Workflow Execution. Within workflow definitions, errors defined are domain specific, meaning they are defined withinthe actual business domain, rather than their technical (programming-language-specific) description. For example, we can define errors such as "Order not found", or "Item not in inventory", rather than having touse terms such as "java.lang.IllegalAccessError", or "response.status == 404", whichmight make little to no sense to our specific problem domain, as well as may not be portable across various runtime implementations. In addition to the domain specific error name, users have the option to also add an optional error codeto help runtime implementations with mapping defined errors to concrete underlying technical ones. Runtime implementations must be able to map the error domain specific name (and the optional error code)to concrete technical errors that arise during Workflow Execution. Known workflow errors, that we know we need to handle during Workflow Execution should be defined inthe workflow top-level 'errors' property. This property can be either a string type, meaning it can referencea reusable JSON or Yaml definition file including the error definitions, or it can have an array type where you candefine these checked errors in-line in your workflow definition. Here is an example of such a definition for both cases: Referencing a reusable JSON/Yaml error definition file: "errors": "file://documents/reusable/errors.json" errors: file://documents/reusable/errors.json Defining workflow errors in-line: "errors": [ "name": "Service not found error", "code": "404", "description": "Server has not found anything matching the provided service endpoint information" errors: - name: Service not found error code: '404' description: Server has not found anything matching the provided service endpoint information These defined errors can then be referenced by their unique name in both states onErrors definitions as well as inactions nonRetryableErrors and retryableErrors properties. Retries allow workflows to deal with intermittent failures of services they are trying to invoke.In addition, retries allow workflows to continue (not fail) execution and allow us to fix possible errors with invokedservices and continue execution after they are fixed.Retries are important for both short-lived and long-lived workflows, as well as in both stateless and statefulscenarios. Serverless workflow supports two distinct ways of defining retries: Retrying on specified known (checked) errors. Automatic retrying on both known (checked) and not-known (unchecked) errors. Which retry option the workflow should use by default is defined via the workflow top-level autoRetries property.By default, the value of the autoRetries is set to false, meaning that retry option 1) is used by default.You can enable automatic retrying (option 2) by setting autoRetries to true. Regardless of the chosen retries option, note that workflows in general should be designed to not fail.Workflows should be able to recover from intermittent failures. The next sections provide more details to each action retry option. This is the default option when the workflow top-level autoRetries property is not specified or is set to false.This retry options is suited for stateless / short-running workflows where retries should be performed when specificallywanted. Note that in this scenario when unknown (unchecked) errors happen during action execution (service invocation),Workflow Execution should fail. Let's take a look at an example. To start, let's define a workflow top-level retries definition: "retries": [ "name": "FirstRetryStrategy", "delay": "PT1M", "maxAttempts": 5 "name": "SecondRetryStrategy", "delay": "PT10M", "maxAttempts": 10 retries: - name: FirstRetryStrategy delay: PT1M maxAttempts: 5 - name: SecondRetryStrategy delay: PT10M maxAttempts: 10 Our retries definitions can be referenced by actions. For example: "actions": [ "functionRef": "MyFirstFunction", "retryRef": "FirstRetryStrategy", "retryableErrors": ["SomeErrorOne", "SomeErrorTwo"] "functionRef": "MySecondFunction", "retryRef": "SecondRetryStrategy", "retryableErrors": ["SomeErrorTwo", "SomeErrorThree"] "functionRef": "MyThirdFunction" - functionRef: MyFirstFunction retryRef: FirstRetryStrategy nonRetryableErrors: - SomeErrorOne - SomeErrorTwo - functionRef: MySecondFunction retryRef: SecondRetryStrategy - SomeErrorThree - functionRef: MyThirdFunction Each action can define the retry strategy it wants to use. If it does not define one, the action is in this case not retries.Actions can define a list of known errors in its retryableErrors array. If defined, then the action should be retriedfor those errors according to the referenced retry strategy. In our example, "MyFirstFunction" invocation should be retried according to the "FirstRetryStrategy" policy only on known errors"SomeErrorOne" and "SomeErrorTwo". If for a known error (defined in retryableErrors) the retry limit is reached and the error still persist, it can be handled in the statesonErrors definition. If an unknown (unchecked) error happens during action execution, and this error is also not handled in the states onErrors definition, theWorkflow Execution should fail. This is the option used when the workflow top-level autoRetries property is set to true.Automatic retries are well suited to long-running and stateful workflow orchestrations. It allows workflowsto recover from failures thus providing more resilience. There is a possible cost associated with automatic retriesin terms of resource and computing power utilization. With this retries option, action executions should be retried automatically for both known (checked) as well as unknown (unchecked)errors. This means that you do not have to define a retry strategy for actions for them to have retried, it's included by default.Users can still define a custom retry strategy for each action via the retryRef property. If a retry strategy is not defined, a default retry strategy should be used.Runtime implementations can define their own default retry strategy. Serverless Workflow recommends the following settings: maxAttempts to be unlimited, meaning that the action should be retried indefinitely until successful. delay to be set to one second, meaning that there is a one second delay between action retries. multiplier to be set to two meaning that the delay should be multiplied by two for each retry attempt. Runtimes should document their default retry strategy to users, so it's clear whichproperty values they are using for the default. Actions can define for which known (checked) errors they should not be retried for.This is done via the actions nonRetryableErrors property. If a known error happens during action executionwhich is included in the nonRetryableErrors property array, that action should not be retried and the errorthen should be handled in the workflow states onErrors property. Let's take a look at an examples of defining retries when using the automatic retries option.This example assumes that the workfow top level autoRetries property is set to true.To start, let's define a workflow top-level retries definition: "name": "DoNotRetryStrategy", "maxAttempts": 1 - name: DoNotRetryStrategy maxAttempts: 1 Our retry definitions can be referenced by state actions. For example: "nonRetryableErrors": ["SomeErrorOne", "SomeErrorTwo"] "nonRetryableErrors": ["SomeErrorTwo", "SomeErrorThree"] "functionRef": "MyFourthFunction", "retryRef": "DoNotRetryStrategy" - functionRef: MyFourthFunction retryRef: DoNotRetryStrategy In our example the first action named MyFirstFunction is going to be retried according to the FirstRetryStrategyretry policyfor all errors except SomeErrorOne and SomeErrorTwo. The seconds action named MySecondFunction is going to be retried according to the SecondRetryStrategyretry policyfor all errors except SomeErrorTwo and SomeErrorThree. The third action named MyThirdFunction is going to retried according to the default runtime retry policy.It will be retried for all errors both known (checked) as well as unknown (unckecked). The fourth action named MyFourthFunction is going to be retried according to the DoNotRetryStrategyretry policy which has the maxAttempts property set to 1, meaning that this action will not be retried. Workflow timeouts define the maximum times for: Workflow execution State execution Action execution Branch execution Event consumption time The specification allows for timeouts to be defined on the top-level workflow definition, as well asin each of the workflow state definitions. Note that the timeout settings defined in states, and state branches overwrite the top-levelworkflow definition for state, action and branch execution. If they are not defined, then the top-leveltimeout settings should take in effect. To give an example, let's say that in our workflow definition we define the timeout for state execution: "id": "testWorkflow", ... "timeouts": { "stateExecTimeout": "PT2S" This top-level workflow timeout setting defines that the maximum execution time of all defined workflow statesis two seconds each. Now let's say that we have worfklow states "A" and "B". State "A" does not define a timeout definition, but state"B" does: "name": "B", "type": "operation", "stateExecTimeout": "PT10S" Since state "A" does not overwrite the top-level stateExecTimeout, its execution timeout should be inherited fromthe top-level timeout definition.On the other hand, state "B" does define it's own stateExecTimeout, in which case it would overwrite the defaultsetting, meaning that it would its execution time has a max limit of ten seconds. Defining timeouts is not mandatory, meaning that if not defined, all the timeout settings should be assumed tobe "unlimited". Note that the defined Workflow Execution timeout has precedence over all other defined timeouts.Just to give an extreme example, let's say we define the Workflow Execution timeout to ten seconds,and the state execution timeout to twenty seconds. In this case if the Workflow Execution timeout is reachedit should follow the rules of Workflow Execution timeout and end Workflow Execution, no matter what thestate execution time has been set to. Let's take a look all possible timeout definitions: Workflow timeouts are defined with the top-level timeouts property. It can have two types, string and object.If string type it defines an URI that points to a Json or Yaml file containing the workflow timeout definitions.If object type, it is used to define the timeout definitions in-line and has the following properties: workflowExecTimeout Workflow execution timeout (ISO 8601 duration format) string or object no stateExecTimeout Workflow state execution timeout (ISO 8601 duration format) string no actionExecTimeout Actions execution timeout (ISO 8601 duration format) string no branchExecTimeout Branch execution timeout (ISO 8601 duration format) string no eventTimeout Default timeout for consuming defined events (ISO 8601 duration format) string no The eventTimeout property defines the maximum amount of time to wait to consume defined events. If not specified it should default to"unlimited". The branchExecTimeout property defines the maximum execution time for a single branch. If not specified it should default to"unlimited". The actionExecTimeout property defines the maximum execution time for a single actions definition. If not specified it should default to"unlimited". Note that an action definition can include multiple actions. The stateExecTimeout property defines the maximum execution time for a single workflow state. If not specified it should default to"unlimited". The workflowExecTimeout property defines the Workflow Execution timeout.It is defined using the ISO 8601 duration format. If not defined, the Workflow Execution should be given "unlimited"amount of time to complete.workflowExecTimeout can have two possibly types, either string or object.If string type, it defines the maximum Workflow Execution time.If Object type it has the following format: WORKFLOWEXECTIMEOUT DEFINITION duration Timeout duration (ISO 8601 duration format) string yes interrupt If false, workflow instance is allowed to finish current execution. If true, current Workflow Execution is stopped immediately. Default is false boolean no runBefore Name of a workflow state to be executed before workflow instance is terminated string no "duration": "PT2M", "runBefore": "createandsendreport" duration: PT2M runBefore: createandsendreport The duration property defines the time duration of the execution timeout. Once a workflow instance is created,and the amount of the defined time is reached, the workflow instance should be terminated. The interrupt property defines if the currently running instance should be allowed to finish its currentexecution flow before it needs to be terminated. If set to true, the current instance execution should stop immediately. The runBefore property defines a name of a workflow state to be executed before workflow instance is terminated.States referenced by runBefore (as well as any other states that they transition to) must obey following rules: They should not have any incoming transitions (should not be part of the main workflow control-flow logic) They cannot be states marked for compensation (have their usedForCompensation property set to true) If it is a single state, it must define an end definition, if it transitions to other states,at last one must define it. They can transition only to states are also not part of the main control flow logic (and are not markedfor compensation). Runtime implementations should raise compile time / parsing exceptions if any of the rules mentioned above arenot obeyed in the workflow definition. All workflow states except Sleep and Inject States can define the timeouts property and can define different timeoutsettings depending on their state type.Please reference each workflow state definitions for more information on whichtimeout settings are available for each state type. Workflow states timeouts cannot define the workflowExecTimeout property. Workflow states can set their stateExecTimeout property inside the timeouts definition.The value of this property is a time duration (ISO 8601 duration format).It must be a duration that's greater than zero and defines the total state execution timeout.When this timeout is reached, state executionshould be stopped and can be handled as a timeout error in the states onErrors definition. Parallel states can define the branchExecTimeout property. If defined on the statelevel, it applies to each branch of the Parallel state. Note that each parallel state branchcan overwrite this setting to define its own branch execution timeout.If a branch does not define this timeout property, it should be inherited from it's state definition branch timeout setting.If its state does not define it either, it should be inherited from the top-level workflow branch timeout settings. The Event state timeouts property can be used tospecify state specific timeout settings. For event state it can contain the eventTimeout propertywhich is defined using the ISO 8601 data and time format.You can specify for example "PT15M" to represent 15 minutes or "P2DT3H4M" to represent 2 days, 3 hours and 4 minutes.eventTimeout values should always be represented as durations and not as specific time intervals. The eventTimeout property needs to be described in detail for Event states as it depends on whether or not the Event state is a workflow starting state or not. If the Event state is a workflow starting state, incoming events may trigger workflow instances. In this case,if the exclusive property is set to true, the eventTimeout property should be ignored. If the exclusive property is set to false, in this case, the defined eventTimeout represents the timebetween arrival of specified events. To give an example, consider the following: "name": "ExampleEventState", "type": "event", "exclusive": false, "timeouts": { "eventTimeout": "PT2M" "onEvents": [ "eventRefs": [ "ExampleEvent1", "ExampleEvent2" ... ] "end": { "terminate": true The first eventTimeout would start once any of the referenced events are consumed. If the second event does not occur withinthe defined eventTimeout, no workflow instance should be created. If the event state is not a workflow starting state, the eventTimeout property is relative to the time when thestate becomes active. If the defined event conditions (regardless of the value of the exclusive property)are not satisfied within the defined timeout period, the event state should transition to the next state or end the workflowinstance in case it is an end state without performing any actions. Compensation deals with undoing or reversing the work of one or more states which havealready successfully completed. For example, let's say that we have charged a customer $100 for an itempurchase. In the case customer laster on decides to cancel this purchase we need to undo it. One way ofdoing that is to credit the customer $100. It's important to understand that compensation with workflows is not the same as for example rolling backa transaction (a strict undo). Compensating a workflow state which has successfully completedmight involve multiple logical steps and thus is part of the overall business logic that must bedefined within the workflow itself. To explain this let's use our previous example and say that when ourcustomer made the item purchase, our workflow has sent her/him a confirmation email. In the case, tocompensate this purchase, we cannot just "undo" the confirmation email sent. Instead, we want tosend a second email to the customer which includes purchase cancellation information. Compensation in Serverless Workflow must be explicitly defined by the workflow control flow logic.It cannot be dynamically triggered by initial workflow data, event payloads, results of service invocations, orerrors. Each workflow state can define how it should be compensated via its compensatedBy property.This property references another workflow state (by its unique name) which is responsible for the actual compensation. States referenced by compensatedBy (as well as any other states that they transition to) must obey following rules: They cannot be an event state They cannot define an end definition. If they do, it should be ignored They must define the usedForCompensation property and set it to true They can transition only to states which also have their usedForCompensation property set to true They cannot themselves set their compensatedBy property to any state (compensation is not recursive) Let's take a look at an example workflow state which defines its compensatedBy property, and the compensationstate it references: "states": [ "name": "NewItemPurchase", "type": "event", "onEvents": [ "eventRefs": [ "NewPurchase" ], "actions": [ "refName": "DebitCustomerFunction", "customerid": "${ .purchase.customerid }", "amount": "${ .purchase.amount }" "refName": "SendPurchaseConfirmationEmailFunction", "customerid": "${ .purchase.customerid }" ] ], "compensatedBy": "CancelPurchase", "transition": "SomeNextWorkflowState" "name": "CancelPurchase", "type": "operation", "usedForCompensation": true, "actions": [ "refName": "CreditCustomerFunction", "customerid": "${ .purchase.customerid }", "amount": "${ .purchase.amount }" "refName": "SendPurchaseCancellationEmailFunction", "customerid": "${ .purchase.customerid }" - name: NewItemPurchase type: event onEvents: - eventRefs: - NewPurchase actions: - functionRef: refName: DebitCustomerFunction arguments: customerid: "${ .purchase.customerid }" amount: "${ .purchase.amount }" refName: SendPurchaseConfirmationEmailFunction compensatedBy: CancelPurchase transition: SomeNextWorkflowState - name: CancelPurchase type: operation usedForCompensation: true refName: CreditCustomerFunction customerid: "${ .purchase.customerid }" amount: "${ .purchase.amount }" refName: SendPurchaseCancellationEmailFunction In this example our "NewItemPurchase" event state waits for a "NewPurchase" event and thendebits the customer and sends them a purchase confirmation email. It defines that it's compensated by the"CancelPurchase" operation state which performs two actions, namely credits back thepurchase amount to customer and sends them a purchase cancellation email. As previously mentioned, compensation must be explicitly triggered by the workflows control-flow logic.This can be done via transition and end definitions. Let's take a look at each: Compensation triggered on transition: "transition": { "compensate": true, "nextState": "NextWorkflowState" transition: compensate: true nextState: NextWorkflowState Transitions can trigger compensations by specifying the compensate property and setting it to true.This means that before the transition is executed (workflow continues its execution to the "NextWorkflowState" in this example),workflow compensation must be performed. Compensation triggered by end definition: "end": { "compensate": true End definitions can trigger compensations by specifying the compensate property and setting it to true.This means that before workflow finishes its execution workflow compensation must be performed. Note thatin case when the end definition has its produceEvents property set, compensation must be performed beforeproducing the specified events and ending Workflow Execution.In the case the end definition has a continueAs property defined, compensation must be performed beforeWorkflow Execution continues as a new workflow invocation.In the case where the end definition has both produceEvents, and continueAs compensation is performed first,then the event should be produced, and then the workflow should continue its execution as a new workflow invocation. Now that we have seen how to define and trigger compensation, we need to go into details on how compensation should be executed.Compensation is performed on all already successfully completed states (that define compensatedBy) in reverse order.Compensation is always done in sequential order, and should not be executed in parallel. Let's take a look at the following workflow image: In this example lets say our Workflow Execution is at the "End" state which defines the compensate property to trueas shown in the previous section. States with a red border, namely "A", "B", "D" and "E" are states which have so farbeen executed successfully. State "C" has not been executed during Workflow Execution in our example. When Workflow Execution encounters our "End" state, compensation has to be performed. This is done in reverse order: State "E" is not compensated as it does not define a compensatedBy state State "D" is compensated by executing compensation "D1" State "B" is compensated by executing "B1" and then "B1-2" State C is not compensated as it was never active during Workflow Execution State A is not comped as it does not define a compensatedBy state So if we look just at the Workflow Execution flow, the same workflow could be seen as: In our example, when compensation triggers,the current workflow data is passed as input to the "D1" state, the first compensation state for our example.The states data output is then passed as states data input to "B1", and so on. In some cases when compensation is triggered, some states such as Parallel and ForEachstates can still be "active", meaning they still might have some async executions that are being performed. If compensation needs to performed on such still active states, the state execution must be first cancelled.After it is cancelled, compensation should be performed. States that are marked as usedForCompensation can define error handling via theironErrors property just like any other workflow states. In case of unrecoverable errors during their execution(errors not explicitly handled),Workflow Execution should be stopped, which is the same behavior as when not using compensation as well. In some cases our workflows are deployed and executed on runtimes and/or cloud platforms that expose someexecution limitations such as finite execution duration, finite number of workflow transitions, etc.Some runtimes, especially when dealing with stateful workflow orchestrations have a finite limit ofexecution history log sizes, meaning that once a long-running workflow reaches these limits Workflow Executions islikely to be forced to stop before reaching its completion. This can result in unexpected issues, especially withmission-critical workflows. For those cases, the Serverless Workflow DSL provides a way to explicitly define stopping the current workflowinstance execution, and starting a new one (for the same workflow id or a different one).This can be done via the end definitions continueAs property. The end definitions continueAs can be either of type string or object.If string type, it contains the unique workflow id of the workflow that the execution should continue as, for example: { "continueAs": "myworkflowid" Defining this should stop the current Workflow Execution, and continue execution as a new workflow instance of theworkflow which defines the workflow id of "myworkflowid". The state data where this is define shouldbecome the workflow data input of the workflow that is continuing the current Workflow Execution. Note that any defined produceEvents and compensate definitions should be honored before continueAs is applied. If object type, the continueAs property has the following properties: workflowId Unique id of the workflow to continue execution as. string yes version Version of the workflow to continue execution as. string no data If string type, a workflow expression which selects parts of the states data output to become the workflow data input of continued execution. If object type, a custom object to become the workflow data input of the continued execution. string or object no workflowExecTimeout Workflow execution timeout to be used by the workflow continuing execution. Overwrites any specific settings set by that workflow. string or object no Continuing execution with continueAs can also be used inside sub-Workflow Executions, which brings its next use case. Workflows can invoke sub-workflows during their execution. In Serverless Workflow DSL, sub-workflows are invokedsimilarly to other function types via the SubFlowRef Definitionin workflow states Action definitions. Just like "parent" workflows, sub-workflow can also be long-running, and can run into the same type of runtime/serverless platformlimitations as previously discussed. As such they can also use continueAs to stop their current execution and continue it asa new one of the same or different workflow id. Note that when a sub-workflow is invoked it can produce a result that is then merged into the parent workflow state data.This may bring up a question as to what happens when a sub-workflow calls continueAs in terms of what is returned asresult to of its invocation by the parent workflow. No matter how many times sub-workflow may use continueAs, to the parent workflow it should be as a single invocation is performed,meaning that the results of the last sub-workflow invocation (triggered by continueAs) should be used as thedata returned by the invocation of the sub-workflow to the parent workflow. In any application, regardless of size or type, one thing is for sure: changes happen.Versioning your workflow definitions is an important task to consider. Versions indicatechanges or updates of your workflow definitions to the associated execution runtimes. There are two places in the workflow definition where versioning can be applied: Top level workflow definition version property. Actions subflowRef version property. The version property must respect the semantic versioning guidelines. Workflow constants are used to define static, and immutable, data which is available to Workflow Expressions. Constants can be defined via the Workflow top-level "constants" property,for example: "constants": { "Translations": { "Dog": { "Serbian": "pas", "Spanish": "perro", "French": "chien" Constants can only be accessed inside Workflow expressions via the $CONST variable.Runtimes must make $CONST available to expressions as a predefined variable. Here is an example of using constants in Workflow expressions: ..., "condition": "${ .applicant | .age >= $CONST.AGE.MIN_ADULT }", "condition": "${ .applicant | .age < $CONST.AGE.MIN_ADULT }", ... Note that constants can also be used in expression functions,for example: "operation": ".applicant | .age >= $CONST.AGE.MIN_ADULT", "operation": ".applicant | .age < $CONST.AGE.MIN_ADULT", Workflow constants values should only contain static data, meaning that their value should notcontain Workflow expressions.Workflow constants data must be immutable.Workflow constants should not have access to Workflow secrets definitions. Secrets allow you access sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, ssh keys, etcinside your Workflow Expressions. You can define the names of secrets via the Workflow top-level "secrets" property,for example: If secrets are defined in a Workflow definition, runtimes must assure to provide their valuesduring Workflow execution. Secrets can be used only in Workflow expressions by referencing them via the $SECRETS variable.Runtimes must make $SECRETS available to expressions as a predefined variable. Here is an example on how to use secrets and pass them as arguments to a function invocation: "secrets": ["AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT", "AZURE_STORAGE_KEY"], "refName": "uploadToAzure", "account": "${ $SECRETS.AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT }", "account-key": "${ $SECRETS.AZURE_STORAGE_KEY }", ... Note that secrets can also be used in expression functions. Secrets are immutable, meaning that workflow expressions are not allowed to change their values. Metadata enables you to enrich the serverless workflow model with information beyond its core definitions.It is intended to be used by clients, such as tools and libraries, as well as users that find this information relevant. Metadata should not affect Workflow Execution. Implementations may choose to use metadata information or ignore it.Note, however, that using metadata to control Workflow Execution can lead to vendor-locked implementations that do not comply with the main goals of this specification, which is to be completely vendor-neutral. Metadata includes key/value pairs (string types). Both keys and values are completely arbitrary and non-identifying. Metadata can be added to: Function definitions Event definitions State definitions Switch state data and event conditions. Here is an example of metadata attached to the core workflow definition: "id": "processSalesOrders", "name": "Process Sales Orders", "start": "MyStartingState", "category": "Sales", "giturl": "github.com/myproject", "author": "Author Name", "team": "Team Name", ... Some other examples of information that could be recorded in metadata are: UI tooling information such as sizing or scaling factors. Build, release, or image information such as timestamps, release ids, git branches, PR numbers, etc. Logging, monitoring, analytics, or audit repository information. Labels used for organizing/indexing purposes, such as "release" "stable", "track", "daily", etc. Similar to Constants and Secrets, workflows expressions can have access to the context information of a running instance via the keyword WORKFLOW. Implementations may use this keyword to give access to any relevant information of the running instance within an expression. For example: "functions": [{ "name": "myFunction", "operation": "myopenapi.json#myFunction" }], "states":[ "name":"MyStartingState", "type":"operation", "actions": [{ "functionRef": "myFunction", "args": { "order": "${ .orderId }", "callerId": "${ $WORKFLOW.instanceId }" }] In this use case, a third-party service may require information from the caller for traceability purposes. The specification doesn't define any specific variable within the WORKFLOW bucket, but it's considered a reserved keyword. The workflow extension mechanism allows you to enhance your model definitions with additional information useful forthings like analytics, rate limiting, logging, simulation, debugging, tracing, etc. Model extensions do no influence control flow logic (Workflow Execution semantics).They enhance it with extra information that can be consumed by runtime systems or tooling andevaluated with the end goal being overall workflow improvements in terms of time, cost, efficiency, etc. Serverless Workflow specification provides extensions which can be found here. You can define extensions in your workflow definition using its top-level extensions property.For more information about this property, see the extensions property in theWorkflow Definition Structure section. Even tho users can define their own extensions, it is encouraged to use the ones provided by the specification.We also encourage users to contribute their extensions to the specification. That way they can be sharedwith the rest of the community. If you have an idea for a new workflow extension, or would like to enhance an existing one,please open an New Extension Request issue in this repository.

They can come from a database, service, file, or be generated in-memory. To add a new dataset in Visual Studio: Right click on the Data Sources folder in Solution Explorer and select Add New Data Source. Choose the data source type (database, service, object, etc). Configure the connection and select the specific database/tables/objects to include. The Dataset Designer allows you to visually shape and configure datasets: Drag tables/objects onto the designer surface to include them. Set primary keys, foreign keys, relations, column data types. Preview and filter the data. Typed Datasets provide a strongly-typed collection of objects to access data: Drag tables onto the Typed Dataset designer. It generates strongly-typed classes to represent each table. You can then program against the strongly-typed dataset. TableAdapters in typed datasets expose methods like Fill, Insert, Update, Delete to manipulate data. You can customize and extend typed datasets, for example: Add custom methods or properties. Add validation logic. Add relations between tables. Generate custom SQL queries. So in summary, Visual Studio provides a graphical way to create datasets from data sources, configure them, and generate strongly-typed code for programming against the data. The Dataset Designer and Typed Dataset features are key tools for this. .md Python .md : import os from pathlib import Path repo_path = Path('/path/to/repo') md_files = [] for root, dirs, files in os.walk(repo_path): for file in files: if file.endswith('.md'): file_path = os.path.join(root, file) md_files.append(file_path) print(f'Found {len(md_files)} .md files') for file in md_files: with open(file, 'r') as f: content = f.read() print(f'Scanned file {file}') : os.walk. md_files .md . .md (, ). .

The Dockerfile for this image is available in the repository here: https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io/-/blob/master/Dockerfile It builds Graphviz from source code and installs it into a Ubuntu base image. It exposes ports 8080 and 8081 for web visualization of graphs. The image description states it can be used to generate graphs from DOT language scripts. This Docker image allows running Graphviz in a portable containerized environment. It can be pulled with docker pull registry.gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io:latest And run like: docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 registry.gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io:latest So in summary, this GitLab container registry link points to an official Docker image for running the Graphviz graph visualization software. The image is built from source and exposes web ports to view generated graphs. Read 10 files Unfortunately I do not have access to run Docker containers directly. However, based on the GitLab container registry link and Docker run command you provided, here is a summary: The command docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 registry.gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io:latest would run the Graphviz Docker image hosted at the GitLab container registry. Specifically: registry.gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io:latest refers to the Docker image location. -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 maps ports 8080 and 8081 from the container to the host machine. This allows accessing the Graphviz web visualization server on those ports after running the container. The image can be pulled with docker pull registry.gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io:latest Once running, Graphviz can be used to generate graphs by passing DOT language scripts to the web UI or API exposed on ports 8080 and 8081.

First, Iam going to explain what Midjourney is and what it can do. Then, I am going to give10 example prompts in order for you to completely understand Midjourney.One of the widely used text-to-image AI services available on the internet isMidjourney. Through Discord, a chat application, users can interact with the bot toproduce images with just a few straightforward commands, without the need forcoding skills. The results are visually attractive images that are easy to create.You can Interact with the Midjourney Bot on Discord using a {{glossary.Command}}.Commands are used to create images, change default settings, monitor user info,and perform other helpful tasks.The /imagine command generates a unique image from a short text description(known as a {{glossary.Prompt}}).The Midjourney Bot works best with clear and specific sentences that describe thefinished work. It does not work well with conversational style lists of requests. Ratherthan providing specific instructions, such as 'Show me a picture of lots of bloomingCalifornia poppies, make them bright, vibrant orange, and draw them in anillustrated style with colored pencils,' try describing what you want in a morestraightforward manner, such as 'Vibrant orange California poppies illustrated withcolored pencils.Generating an image activates the free Midjourney trial.Trial users can make roughly25 Jobs before needing to subscribe. A Job is any action that uses the MidjourneyBot. Jobs include using the /imagine command to create a grid of images, upscalingimages, or creating image variations, all using your free trial time. Use the /infocommand to check your Fast Time Remaining to see your remaining Trial time.Here are some prompting notes:Prompt LengthPrompts can be very simple. Single words (or even an emoji!) will produce an image.Very short prompts will rely heavily on Midjourneys default style, so a more descriptive prompt is better for a unique look. However, super-long prompts arentalways better. Concentrate on the main concepts you want to create.GrammarThe Midjourney Bot does not understand grammar, sentence structure, or words likehumans. Word choice also matters. More specific synonyms work better in manycircumstances. Instead of big, try gigantic, enormous, or immense. Remove wordswhen possible. Fewer words mean each word has a more powerful influence. Usecommas, brackets, and hyphens to help organize your thoughts, but know theMidjourney Bot will not reliably interpret them. The Midjourney Bot does notconsider capitalization. Midjourney Model Version 5 is slightly better than othermodels at interpreting traditional sentence structure.Focus on What you WantIt is better to describe what you want instead of what you dont want. If you ask for aparty with no cake, your image will probably include a cake. If you want to ensurean object is not in the final image, try advance prompting using the --no parameter.Think About What Details MatterAnything left unsaid may surprise you. Be as specific or vague as you want, butanything you leave out will be randomized. Being vague is a great way to get variety,but you may not get the specific details you want.Try to be clear about any context or details that are important to you. Thinkabout:Subject: person, animal, character, location, object, etc.Medium: photo, painting, illustration, sculpture, doodle, tapestry, etc.Environment: indoors, outdoors, on the moon, in Narnia, underwater, the EmeraldCity, etc.Lighting: soft, ambient, overcast, neon, studio lights, etcColor: vibrant, muted, bright, monochromatic, colorful, black and white, pastel, etc.Mood: Sedate, calm, raucous, energetic, etc.Composition: Portrait, headshot, closeup, birds-eye view, etc.Use Collective NounsPlural words leave a lot to chance. Try specific numbers. "Three cats" is more specificthan "cats." Collective nouns also work, flock of birds instead of "birds. Parameters AvailableAspect Ratios--aspect, or --ar Change the aspect ratio of a generation.Chaos--chaos <number 0100> Change how varied the results will be. Higher valuesproduce more unusual and unexpected generations.No--no Negative prompting, --no plants would try to remove plants from the image.Quality--quality <.25, .5, 1, or 2>, or --q <.25, .5, 1, or 2> How much rendering quality time youwant to spend. The default value is 1. Higher values cost more and lower values costless.Repeat--repeat <140>, or --r <140> Create multiple Jobs from a single prompt. --repeat isuseful for quickly rerunning a job multiple times.Seed--seed <integer between 04294967295> The Midjourney bot uses a seed number tocreate a field of visual noise, like television static, as a starting point to generate theinitial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can bespecified with the --seed or --sameseed parameter. Using the same seed numberand prompt will produce similar ending images.Stop--stop <integer between 10100> Use the --stop parameter to finish a Job part waythrough the process. Stopping a Job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, lessdetailed results.Style--style <4a, 4b, or 4c> Switch between versions of the Midjourney Model Version 4--style <expressive, or cute> Switch between versions of the Niji Model VersionStylize--stylize, or --s parameter influences how strongly Midjourney'sdefault aesthetic style is applied to Jobs. Uplight--uplight Use an alternative "light" upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The resultsare closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image is less detailed andsmoother.Upbeta--upbeta Use an alternative beta upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The resultsare closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image has significantly feweradded details.Midjourney routinely releases new model versions to improve efficiency, coherency,and quality. Different models excel at different types of images.Niji--niji An alternative model focused on anime style images.Test--test Use the Midjourney special test model.Testp--testp Use the Midjourney special photography-focused test model.Version--version <1, 2, 3, 4, or 5> or --v <1, 2, 3, 4, or 5> Use a different version of the Midjourneyalgorithm. The current algorithm (V4) is the default setting.Now that you understand the basics of MidJourney here are some example promptsto further understand how these are typed out:astronaut playing chess against a monkey, 2d flat, simple, vibrant, neon colors, fun,groovy, chess pieces floating, set on the moon, movie poster, epica magical, vibrant, steampunk, Erlenmeyer Flask with a red, boiling substance, sittingon a white table, white background, 4kjapanese lofi style, the streets of neo tokyo, with a porsche 911 in the street, massiveskyscraper in the background, 64 bit style, shadows and lighting, clean, simple,satisfyingDreamy pastel portrait, female model, long wavy hair, soft gaze, flowery headpiece,delicate makeup, ethereal atmosphere, soft focus, medium format film, MamiyaRZ67, Fujifilm Pro 400H, f3.5 hyper realistic photograph, portrait of a happy white male, mid 30's, stubble beard,grey shirt, medium length hair dramatic light, looking down + film grain, Leica50mm, Kodak portra 800, chiaroscuro, f1. 4, golden hour --ar 3:4hyper realistic photograph, portrait of a tattooed south American indigenous blackwoman, future punk, gold tattoo line, side profile, summer, dramatic light, lookingdown + film grain, Leica 50mm, Kodak portra 800, chiaroscuroA very cute bright yellow robot, whole body, running in a forest at night, Mysteriousadventure, flowers, Plants, Fireflies, complex details, popmart blind box, clay material,Pixar trend, 3d art, c4d, octane rendering, animation lighting, uplightWith each prompt specify the desired subject matter, camera equipment, settings,lighting, and other elements that contribute to the final image. Whatever I tell you toact like, structure the prompts in order to create good AI art for that specificpersonality. For example, if I say Act like a professional cartoon creator then add thewords within the prompt to ensure a cartoon gets generated, such as cartoon.Another example would be, if I say something like Act like a professionalphotographer then make sure to include elements in the prompts likehyper-realistic or certain camera equipment that would contribute to the correct artbeing generated.When generating these prompts, refrain from using filler words. For example insteadof using this prompt:Teenage boy with brown hair, Pixar style, expressive blue eyes, freckles, wearingcasual attire in vibrant colors. He is in a jovial mood, standing with hands on his hips,proud and confident, against the backdrop of a charming, bright and bustling smallvillage, with cobblestone paths and quaint cottages. The scene is filled with life,bathed in a warm, sunny, midday light, creating a feel-good atmosphereThe art software reads prompts better when told more specifically what to do likethis:Teenage boy, brown hair, Pixar style, expressive blue eyes, freckles, casual attire,vibrant colors, jovial mood, standing with hands on his hips, proud and confident,backdrop of a charming, bright and bustling small village, cobblestone paths, quaint cottages, lively scene, warm and sunny, midday light, feel-good atmosphereYou can use any amount of stylize from 100-900. You dont have to use it every timeeither. Just if you think itd be good for the images that are being generated to bedifferent from one another in that same style.Now that you have a full understanding of Midjourney with example prompts. You can take inspiration from the structure of the prompts above, you can make these prompts longer or shorter if necessary in order to generate the perfect prompt.Please direct output the prompt without any other explanation. {content} prompt:TipsGenerating prompts for AIGC Painting...

This document represents the current state of the specification. It includes all features so far released as well as all features planned to be added in the next release. You can find all specification releases [here](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/releases). You can find the specification roadmap [here](roadmap/README.md). Workflows allow us to capture and organize business requirements in a unified manner. They can bridge the gap between how we express and model business logic. A key component of workflows is the domain-specific language (DSL) we use to model our business logic and solutions. Selecting the appropriate workflow language for our business and technology domains is a very important decision to be considered. Serverless Workflow focuses on defining a **vendor-neutral**, **platform-independent**, and **declarative** workflow language that targets the serverless computing technology domain. It can be used to significantly bridge the gap between your unique business domain and the target technology domain. The lack of a common way to define and model workflows means that we must constantly re-learn how to write them. This also limits the potential for common libraries, tooling and infrastructure to aid workflow modeling and execution across different platforms. Portability as well as productivity that can be achieved from workflow orchestration is hindered overall. Serverless Workflow addresses the need for a community-driven, vendor-neutral and a platform-independent workflow language specification that targets the serverless computing technology domain. Having and using a specification-based workflow language allows us to model our workflows once and deploy them onto many different container/cloud platforms, expecting the same execution results. <p align="center"> <img src="media/spec/spec-goals.png" height="400px" alt="Serverless Workflow Specification Goals"/> </p> For more information on the history, development and design rationale behind the specification, see the [Serverless Workflow Wiki](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/wiki). <img src="media/spec/spec-parts.png" width="600" alt="Serverless Workflow Specification Focus On Standards"/> Serverless Workflow language takes advantage of well-established and known standards such as [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/), [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specifications, [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). <img src="media/spec/spec-overview.png" height="400px" alt="Serverless Workflow Specification Overview"/> * Definitions of the workflow language. This is defined via the [Workflow JSON Schema](schema/workflow.json). You can use both [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) and [YAML](https://yaml.org/) formats to model your workflows. * Software Development Kits (SDKs) for [Go](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-go), [Java](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-java), [.NET](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-net), [Typescript](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-typescript) and [Python](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-python), and we plan to add them for more languages in the future. * Set of [Workflow Extensions](extensions/README.md) which allow users to define additional, non-execution-related workflow information. This information can be used to improve workflow performance. Some example workflow extensions include Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), Rate Limiting, Simulation, Tracing, etc. * Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) to be used as a specification conformance tool for runtime implementations. A workflow definition is a JSON or YAML file that conforms to the Serverless Workflow specification DSL. It consists of the core [Workflow Definition Structure](#Workflow-Definition-Structure) and the [Workflow Model](#Workflow-Model) It defines a blueprint used by runtimes for its execution. A business solution can be composed of any number of related workflow definitions. Their relationships are explicitly modeled with the Serverless Workflow language (for example by using [SubFlowRef Definition](#SubFlowRef-Definition) in actions). A workflow instance represents a single Workflow Execution corresponding to the instructions provided by a workflow definition. A workflow instance can be short or long-running. A single workflow instance should be isolated, meaning it should not share state and data with other workflow instances. Workflow instances should be able to communicate with each other via events. Depending on their workflow definition, workflow instances can be short-lived or can execute for days, weeks, or years. Each workflow instances should have its unique identifier, which should remain unchanged throughout its execution. Workflow instances can be started providing some data input. This is described in detail in the [workflow data input](#Workflow-Data-Input) section. Workflow instances can also wait for examples to start their execution, which is the case where a workflow definition contains a [EventState](#Event-State) starting workflow state. The workflow definition also explicitly defines when a workflow instance should be completed. By default, instances should be completed once there are no active workflow paths (all active paths reach a state containing the default [end definition](#End-Definition)), or if the defined [`workflowExecTimeout`](#Workflow-Timeouts) time is reached. Other ways, such as using the `terminate` property of the [end definition](#End-Definition) to terminate instance execution, or defining an [`workflowExecTimeout`](#Workflow-Timeouts) property are also possible. For long-running workflow-executions, you can utilize the `keepActive` workflow property which provides more control as to when exactly to terminate Workflow Execution. In cases where a Workflow Execution should be continued as a new one, the DSL also provides the `continueAs` property which is described in detail in the [Continuing a new Execution](#Continuing-as-a-new-Execution) section. * [Function definitions](#Function-Definition) - Reusable functions that can declare services that need to be invoked, or expressions to be evaluated. * [Event definitions](#Event-Definition) - Reusable declarations of events that need to be `consumed` to start or continue workflow instances, trigger function/service execution, or be `produced` during Workflow Execution. * [Retry definitions](#Retry-Definition) - Reusable retry definitions. Can specify retry strategies for service invocations during Workflow Execution. * [Timeout definitions](#Workflow-Timeouts) - Reusable timeout definitions. Can specify default Workflow Execution timeout, as well as workflow state, action, and branch execution timeouts. * [Errors definition](#Defining-Errors) - Reusable error definitions. Provide domain-specific error definitions which can be referenced in workflow states error handling. * [State definitions](#Workflow-States) - Definition of states, the building blocks of workflow `control flow logic`. States can reference the reusable function, event and retry definitions. Serverless Workflow data is represented in [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) format. Data flow and execution logic go hand in hand, meaning as Workflow Execution follows the workflow definition logic, so does the workflow data: <img src="media/spec/workflowdataflow.png" height="400" alt="Serverless Workflow Data Flow"/> The initial [Workflow data input](#Workflow-data-input) is passed to the workflow starting state as its data input. When a state finishes its execution, [its data output is passed as data input to the next state](#Information-passing-Between-States) that should be executed. When Workflow Execution ends, the last executed workflow state's data output becomes the final [Workflow data output](#Workflow-data-output). States can filter their data inputs and outputs using [State Data filters](#State-data-filters). States can also consume events as well as invoke services. These event payloads and service invocation results can be filtered using [Event data filters](#Event-data-filters) and [Action data filters](#Action-data-filters). Data filters use [workflow expressions](#Workflow-Expressions) for selecting and manipulating state data input and output, action inputs and results, and event payloads. Multiple filters can be combined to gain high level of control of your workflow state data. You can find an example of that in [this](#Using-multiple-data-filters) section. Data from consumed events,and action execution results are added/merged to state data. Reference the [data merging section](#Data-Merging) to learn about the merging rules that should be applied. The initial data input into a workflow instance. Must be a valid [JSON object](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-4). If no input is provided, the default data input should be an empty JSON object: ```json <img src="media/spec/workflowdatainput.png" height="350px" alt="Workflow data input"/> States in a workflow can receive data (data input) and produce a data result (data output). The state's data input is typically the previous state's data output. When a state completes its execution, its data output is passed to the state's data input it transitions to. There are two rules to consider here: - If the state is the workflow starting state, its data input is the [workflow data input](#Workflow-data-input). - When Workflow Execution ends, the data output of the last executed state becomes the [workflow data output](#Workflow-data-output). <img src="media/spec/basic-state-data-passing.png" height="350px" alt="Basic state data passing"/> Each Workflow Execution should produce a data output. The workflow data output is the data output of the last executed workflow state. | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | input | Workflow expression to filter the states data input | string | no | | output | Workflow expression that filters the states data output | string | no | <details><summary><strong>Click to view example definition</strong></summary> <p> <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <td valign="top"> </td> ```yaml </table> </details> The state data filters `input` property expression is applied when the workflow transitions to the current state and receives its data input. It can be used to select only data that is needed and disregard what is not needed. If `input` is not defined or does not select any parts of the state's data input, its data input is not filtered. The state data filter `output` property expression is applied right before the state transitions to the next state defined. It filters the state's data output to be passed as data input to the transitioning state. If the current state is the workflow end state, the filtered state's data output becomes the workflow data output. If `output` is not defined or does not select any parts of the state's data output, its data output is not filtered. Results of the `input` expression should become the state data input. Results of the `output` expression should become the state data output. For more information on this you can reference the [data merging](#Data-Merging) section. For the first example, our state only cares about fruits data, and we want to disregard the vegetables. To do this we can define a state filter: <img src="media/spec/state-data-filter-example1.png" height="400px" alt="State Data Filter Example"/> For our second example, let's say that we are interested in the only vegetable "veggie-like". Here we have two ways of filtering our data, depending on if actions within our state need access to all vegetables, or only the ones that are "veggie-like". The states data input filter selects all the vegetables from the main data input. Once all actions have performed, before the state transition or Workflow Execution completion (if this is an end state), the "output" of the state filter selects only the vegetables which are "veggie like". <img src="media/spec/state-data-filter-example2.png" height="400px" alt="State Data Filter Example"/> | fromStateData | Workflow expression that filters state data that can be used by the action | string | no | | useResults | If set to `false`, action data results are not added/merged to state data. In this case 'results' and 'toStateData' should be ignored. Default is `true`. | boolean | no | | results | Workflow expression that filters the actions data results | string | no | | toStateData | Workflow expression that selects a state data element to which the action results should be added/merged into. If not specified denotes the top-level state data element | string | no | Action data filters can be used inside [Action definitions.](#Action-Definition) Each action can define this filter which can: * Filter the state data to select only the data that can be used within function definition arguments using its `fromStateData` property. * Filter the action results to select only the result data that should be added/merged back into the state data using its `results` property. * Select the part of state data which the action data results should be added/merged to using the `toStateData` property. To give an example, let's say we have an action which returns a list of breads and pasta types. For our workflow, we are only interested into breads and not the pasta. The `results` will filter the action results, which would then be: In this case, our `results` select the first bread and the second element of the pasta array. The `toStateData` expression then selects the `itemsToBuyAtStore` array of the state data to add/merge these results into. With this, after our action executes the state data would be: In the case action results should not be added/merged to state data, we can set the `useResults` property to `false`. In this case, the `results` and `toStateData` properties should be ignored, and nothing is added/merged to state data. If `useResults` is not specified (or it's value set to `true`), action results, if available, should be added/merged to state data. | useData | If set to `false`, event payload is not added/merged to state data. In this case 'data' and 'toStateData' should be ignored. Default is `true`. | boolean | no | | data | Workflow expression that filters the event data (payload) | string | no | Event data filters can be used to filter consumed event payloads. They can be used to: * Filter the event payload to select only the data that should be added/merged into the state data using its `data` property. * Select the part of state data into which the event payload should be added/merged into Allows event data to be filtered and added to or merged with the state data. All events have to be in the CloudEvents format and event data filters can filter both context attributes and the event payload (data) using the `data` property. <img src="media/spec/event-data-filter-example1.png" height="400px" alt="Event Data Filter Example"/> Note that the data input to the Event data filters depends on the `dataOnly` property of the associated [Event definition](#Event-Definition). If this property is not defined (has default value of `true`), Event data filter expressions are evaluated against the event payload (the CloudEvents `data` attribute only). If it is set to `false`, the expressions should be evaluated against the entire CloudEvent (including its context attributes). In the case event data/payload should not be added/merged to state data, we can set the `useData` property to `false`. In this case, the `data` and `toStateData` properties should be ignored, and nothing is added/merged to state data. If `useData` is not specified (or it's value set to `true`), event payload, if available, should be added/merged to state data. As [Event states](#Event-State) can take advantage of all defined data filters. In the example below, we define a workflow with a single event state and show how data filters can be combined. "spanish": "Adios", Here is a sample diagram showing our workflow, each numbered step on this diagram shows a certain defined point during Workflow Execution at which data filters are invoked and correspond to the numbered items below. <img src="media/spec/using-multiple-filters-example.png" height="400px" alt="Using Multple Filters Example"/> **(1) Workflow execution starts**: Workflow data is passed to our "WaitForCustomerToArrive" event state as data input. Workflow executes its starting state, namely the "WaitForCustomerToArrive" event state. The event state **stateDataFilter** is invoked to filter its data input. The filters "input" expression is evaluated and selects only the "greetings" data. The rest of the state data input should be disregarded. "spanish": "Adios", **(2) CloudEvent of type "customer-arrival-type" is consumed**: Once the event is consumed, the "eventDataFilter" is triggered. Its "data" expression selects the "customer" object from the events data. The "toStateData" expression says that we should add/merge this selected event data to the state data in its "customerInfo" property. If this property exists it should be merged, if it does not exist, one should be created. "spanish": "Adios", **(3) Event state performs its actions**: Before the first action is executed, its actionDataFilter is invoked. Its "fromStateData" expression filters the current state data to select from its data that should be available to action arguments. In this example it selects the "hello" and "customerInfo" properties from the current state data. At this point the action is executed. We assume that for this example "greetingFunction" returns: The action filters "toStateData" expression then defines that we want to add/merge this action result to state data under the "finalCustomerGreeting" element. **(4) Event State Completes Execution**: When our event state finishes its execution, the states "stateDataFilter" "output" filter expression is executed to filter the state data to create the final state data output. Because our event state is also an end state, its data output becomes the final [workflow data output](#Workflow-data-output). Namely: Consumed event data (payload) and action execution results should be merged into the state data. Event and action data filters can be used to give more details about this operation. By default, with no data filters specified, when an event is consumed, its entire data section (payload) should be merged to the state data. Merging should be applied to the entire state data JSON element. In case of event and action filters, their "toStateData" property can be defined to select a specific element of the state data with which merging should be done against. If this element does not exist, a new one should be created first. When merging, the state data element and the data (payload)/action result should have the same type, meaning that you should not merge arrays with objects or objects with arrays etc. When merging elements of type object should be done by inserting all the key-value pairs from both objects into a single combined object. If both objects contain a value for the same key, the object of the event data/action results should "win". To give an example, let's say we have the following state data: Merging array types should be done by concatenating them into a larger array including unique elements of both arrays. To give an example, merging: Merging number types should be done by overwriting the data from events data/action results into the merging element of the state data. For example merging action results: Workflow [functions](#Function-Definition) are reusable definitions for service invocations and/or expression evaluation. They can be referenced by their domain-specific names inside workflow [states](#Workflow-States). * [Using functions for RESTful service invocations](#Using-Functions-for-RESTful-Service-Invocations) * [Using Functions for Async API Service Invocations](#Using-Functions-for-Async-API-Service-Invocations) * [Using functions for gRPC service invocation](#Using-Functions-For-RPC-Service-Invocations) * [Using functions for GraphQL service invocation](#Using-Functions-For-GraphQL-Service-Invocations) * [Using Functions for OData Service Invocations](#Using-Functions-for-OData-Service-Invocations) * [Using functions for expression evaluations](#Using-Functions-For-Expression-Evaluation) * [Defining custom function types](#defining-custom-function-types) We can define if functions are invoked sync or async. Reference the [functionRef](#FunctionRef-Definition) to learn more on how to do this. [Functions](#Function-Definition) can be used to describe services and their operations that need to be invoked during Workflow Execution. They can be referenced by states [action definitions](#Action-Definition) to clearly define when the service operations should be invoked during Workflow Execution, as well as the data parameters passed to them if needed. Note that with Serverless Workflow, we can also define invocation of services which are triggered via an event. To learn more about that, please reference the [event definitions](#Event-Definition) section, as well as the [actions definitions](#Action-Definition) [eventRef](#EventRef-Definition) property. Because of an overall lack of a common way to describe different services and their operations, many workflow languages typically chose to define custom function definitions. This approach, however, often runs into issues such as lack of portability, limited capabilities, as well as forcing non-workflow-specific information, such as service authentication, to be added inside the workflow language. To avoid these issues, the Serverless Workflow specification mandates that details about RESTful services and their operations be described using the [OpenAPI Specification](https://www.openapis.org/). OpenAPI is a language-agnostic standard that describes discovery of RESTful services. This allows Serverless Workflow language to describe RESTful services in a portable way, as well as workflow runtimes to utilize OpenAPI tooling and APIs to invoke service operations. It can, as previously mentioned be referenced during Workflow Execution when the invocation of this service is desired. For example: Note that the referenced function definition type in this case must be `rest` (default type). For more information about functions, reference the [Functions definitions](#Function-Definition) section. [Functions](#Function-Definition) can be used to invoke PUBLISH and SUBSCRIBE operations on a message broker documented by the [Async API Specification](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/v2.1.0). [Async API operations](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/v2.1.0#operationObject) are bound to a [channel](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/v2.1.0#definitionsChannel) which describes the technology, security mechanisms, input and validation to be used for their execution. Let's take a look at a hypothetical Async API document (assumed its stored locally with the file name `streetlightsapi.yaml`) and define a single publish operation: To define a workflow action invocation, we can then use the following workflow [Function Definition](#Function-Definition) and set the `operation` to `onLightMeasured`: Note that the [Function Definition](#Function-Definition)'s `operation` property must have the following format: ```text Also note that the referenced function definition type in this case must have the value `asyncapi`. Our defined function definition can then we referenced in a workflow [action](#Action-Definition), for example: Similar to defining invocations of operations on RESTful services, you can also use the workflow [functions definitions](#Function-Definition) that follow the remote procedure call (RPC) protocol. For RPC invocations, the Serverless Workflow specification mandates that they are described using [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), a widely used RPC system. gRPC uses [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) to define messages, services, and the methods on those services that can be invoked. Let's look at an example of invoking a service method using RPC. For this example let's say we have the following gRPC protocol buffer definition in a myuserservice.proto file: Note that the `operation` property has the following format: Note that the referenced function definition type in this case must be `rpc`. We'll use the following [GraphQL schema definition](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/) to show how that would work with both a query and a mutation: ```graphql In our workflow definition, we can then use a function definition for the `pet` query field as such: Note that the `operation` property has the following format for the `graphql` type: In order to invoke this query, we would use the following `functionRef` parameters: With the parameters for the `functionRef`: Note you can include [expressions](#Workflow-Expressions) in both `arguments` and `selectionSet`: Similar to defining invocations of operations on GraphQL services, you can also use workflow [Functions Definitions](#Function-Definition) to execute complex queries on an [OData](https://www.odata.org/documentation/) service. We start off by creating a workflow [Functions Definitions](#Function-Definition). For example: Note that the `operation` property must follow the following format: In order to invoke the defined [OData](https://www.odata.org/documentation/) function, simply reference it in a workflow [Action Definition](#Action-Definition) and set its function arguments. For example: In order to ensure compatibility of OData support across runtimes, the`arguments` property of an [OData](https://www.odata.org/documentation/) function reference should follow the Serverless Workflow [OData Json schema](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/tree/main/schema/odata.json) In addition to defining RESTful, AsyncAPI, RPC, GraphQL and OData services and their operations, workflow [functions definitions](#Function-Definition) can also be used to define expressions that should be evaluated during Workflow Execution. Defining expressions as part of function definitions has the benefit of being able to reference them by their logical name through workflow states where expression evaluation is required. Expression functions must declare their `type` parameter to be `expression`. Here we define two reusable expression functions. Expressions in Serverless Workflow can be evaluated against the workflow, or workflow state data. Note that different data filters play a big role as to which parts of the workflow data are being evaluated by the expressions. Reference the [State Data Filters](#State-data-filters) section for more information on this. Our expression functions can also be referenced and executed as part of state [action](#Action-Definition) execution. Let's say we have the following workflow definition: The starting [inject state](#Inject-State) "Initialize Count" injects the count element into our state data, which then becomes the state data input of our "Increment Count" [operation state](#Operation-State). This state defines an invocation of the "Increment Count Function" expression function defined in our workflow definition. This triggers the evaluation of the defined expression. The input of this expression is by default the current state data. Just like with "rest", and "rpc" type functions, expression functions also produce a result. In this case the result of the expression is just the number 1. The actions filter then assigns this result to the state data element "count" and the state data becomes: ``` json Note that the used function definition type in this case must be `expression`. For more information about workflow expressions, reference the [Workflow Expressions](#Workflow-Expressions) section. [Function definitions](#function-definition) `type` property defines a list of function types that are set by the specification. Some runtime implementations might support additional function types that extend the ones defined in the specification. In those cases you can define a custom function type with for example: In this example we define a custom function type that is meant to execute an external [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) script. When a custom function type is specified, the operation property value has a **custom format**, meaning that its format is controlled by the runtime which provides the custom function type. Note that different data filters play a big role as to which parts of the states data are to be used when the expression is evaluated. Reference the [State Data Filtering](#State-data-filters) section for more information about state data filters. By default, all workflow expressions should be defined using the [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) [version 1.6](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases/tag/jq-1.6) syntax. You can find more information on jq in its [manual](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/). Serverless Workflow does not mandate the use of jq and it's possible to use an expression language of your choice with the restriction that a single one must be used for all expressions in a workflow definition. If a different expression language needs to be used, make sure to set the workflow `expressionLang` property to identify it to runtime implementations. Note that using a non-default expression language could lower the portability of your workflow definitions across multiple container/cloud platforms. All workflow expressions in this document, [specification examples](examples/README.md) as well as [comparisons examples](comparisons/README.md) are written using the default jq syntax. Where `expression` can be either an in-line expression, or a reference to a defined [expression function definition](#Using-Functions-For-Expression-Evaluation). To reference a defined [expression function definition](#Using-Functions-For-Expression-Evaluation) the expression must have the following format, for example: Where `fn` is the namespace of the defined expression functions and `myExprName` is the unique expression function name. We will get back to this function definition in just a bit, but now let's take a look at using an inline expression that sets an input parameter inside an action for example: In this case our input parameter `applicantName` would be set to "John Doe". Expressions can also be used to select and manipulate state data, this is in particularly useful for state data filters. [Switch state](#Switch-State) [conditions](#Switch-State-Data-Conditions) require for expressions to be resolved to a boolean value (`true`/`false`). As previously mentioned, expressions are evaluated against certain subsets of data. For example the `parameters` param of the [functionRef definition](#FunctionRef-Definition) can evaluate expressions only against the data that is available to the [action](#Action-Definition) it belongs to. One thing to note here are the top-level [workflow definition](#Workflow-Definition-Structure) parameters. Expressions defined in them can only be evaluated against the initial [workflow data input](#Workflow-Data-Input). which would set the workflow version to "1.0.0". Note that the workflow "id" property value is not allowed to use an expression. The workflow definition "id" must be a constant value. | --- | --- | --- | --- | | id | Workflow unique identifier | string | yes (if `key` is not defined) | | key | Domain-specific workflow identifier | string | yes (if `id` is not defined) | | name | Workflow name | string | no | | description | Workflow description | string | no | | version | Workflow version. MUST respect the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) format | string | no | | annotations | List of helpful terms describing the workflows intended purpose, subject areas, or other important qualities | array | no | | dataInputSchema | Used to validate the workflow data input against a defined JSON Schema| string or object | no | | dataOutputSchema | Used to validate the workflow data output against a defined JSON Schema| string or object | no | | [constants](#Workflow-Constants) | Workflow constants | string or object | no | | [secrets](#Workflow-Secrets) | Workflow secrets | string or array | no | | [start](#Start-Definition) | Workflow start definition | string or object | no | | specVersion | Serverless Workflow specification release version | string | yes | | expressionLang | Identifies the expression language used for workflow expressions. Default value is "jq" | string | no | | [timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) | Defines the workflow default timeout settings | string or object | no | | [errors](#Defining-Errors) | Defines checked errors that can be explicitly handled during Workflow Execution | string or array | no | | keepActive | If `true`, workflow instances is not terminated when there are no active execution paths. Instance can be terminated with "terminate end definition" or reaching defined "workflowExecTimeout" | boolean | no | | [auth](#Auth-Definition) | Workflow authentication definitions | array or string | no | | [events](#Event-Definition) | Workflow event definitions. | array or string | no | | [functions](#Function-Definition) | Workflow function definitions. Can be either inline function definitions (if array) or URI pointing to a resource containing json/yaml function definitions (if string) | array or string| no | | autoRetries | If set to `true`, [actions](#Action-Definition) should automatically be retried on unchecked errors. Default is `false` | boolean| no | | [retries](#Retry-Definition) | Workflow retries definitions. Can be either inline retries definitions (if array) or URI pointing to a resource containing json/yaml retry definitions (if string) | array or string| no | | [states](#Workflow-States) | Workflow states | array | yes | | [extensions](#Extensions) | Workflow extensions definitions | array or string | no | | [metadata](#Workflow-Metadata) | Metadata information | object | no | Defines the top-level structure of a serverless workflow model. Following figure describes the main workflow definition blocks. <img src="media/spec/workflowdefinitionblocks.png" height="300px" alt="Serverless Workflow Definitions Blocks"/> The `id` property defines the unique, domain-specific workflow identifier, for example "orders", "payment", etc. The `key` property defines the unique, domain-specific workflow identifier. It can be used when the `id` property is auto-generated by a content-management system for example. In these cases, you can specify the `key` property to be the domain-specific identifier of the workflow definition. The `id` and `key` properties are mutually exclusive, meaning you cannot define both. The `name` property is the workflow logical name. The `description` property can be used to give further information about the workflow. The `version` property can be used to provide a specific workflow version. It must use the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) format. The `annotations` property defines a list of helpful terms describing the workflows intended purpose, subject areas, or other important qualities, for example "machine learning", "monitoring", "networking", etc The `dataInputSchema` and `dataOutputSchema` properties can be used to validate input and output data against a defined JSON Schema. The `dataInputSchema` property validates the [workflow data input](#Workflow-Data-Input). Validation should be performed before any states are executed. In case of a start [Event state](#Event-state) the input schema is ignored, if present. The `failOnValidationErrors` property determines if Workflow Execution should continue in case of validation errors. The `dataOutputSchema` property validates the [Workflow data output](#workflow-data-output). Validation is performed on the output of the Workflow Execution. The `failOnValidationErrors` property determines what should be done when the workflow output does not match the provided schema. If `failOnValidationErrors` is true, an error should be thrown. If executed within a subprocess, that error can be be handled by the parent workflow. If `failOnValidationErrors` is false, the error should not be propagated. It is up to the implementor to warn the user about that fact. For example, printing a log. Both properties can be expressed as object or string type. If using object type, their `schema` property might be an URI, which points to the JSON schema used to validate the workflow data input, or it might be the JSON schema object. `failOnValidationErrors` is optional, default value is `true`. If using string type, then the string value is the external schema URI and `failOnValidationErrors` default value of `true` is assumed. The `secrets` property allows you to use sensitive information such as passwords, OAuth tokens, ssh keys, etc. inside your Workflow expressions. It has two possible types, `string` or `array`. If `string` type, it is an URI pointing to a JSON or YAML document which contains an array of names of the secrets, for example: If `array` type, it defines an array (of string types) which contains the names of the secrets, for example: For more information about Workflow secrets, reference the [Workflow Secrets section](#Workflow-Secrets). The `constants` property can be used to define Workflow constants values which are accessible in [Workflow Expressions](#Workflow-Expressions). It has two possible types, `string` or `object`. which contains an object of global definitions, for example: If `object` type, it defines a JSON object which contains the constants definitions, for example: For more information see the [Workflow Constants](#Workflow-Constants) section. The `start` property defines the workflow starting information. For more information see the [start definition](#Start-Definition) section. This property is not required. If not defined, the workflow starting state has to be the very first state defined in the [workflow states array](#Workflow-States). The `specVersion` property is used to set the Serverless Workflow specification release version the workflow markup adheres to. It has to follow the specification release versions (excluding the leading "v"), meaning that for the [release version v0.8](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/releases/tag/v0.8) its value should be set to `"0.8"`. The `expressionLang` property can be used to identify the expression language used for all expressions in the workflow definition. The default value of this property is ["jq"](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/). You should set this property if you chose to define [workflow expressions](#Workflow-Expressions) with an expression language / syntax other than the default. The `timeouts` property is used to define the default workflow timeouts for workflow, state, action, and branch execution. For more information about timeouts and its use cases see the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section. The `error` property is used to define checked errors that can be explicitly handled during Workflow Execution. For more information about workflow error handling see [this section](#Defining-Errors). The `auth` property can be either an inline [auth](#Auth-Definition) definition array, or a URI reference to a resource containing an array of [auth](#Auth-Definition) definitions. If defined in a separate resource file (Json or Yaml), `auth` definitions can be re-used by multiple workflow definitions. Auth definitions can be used to define authentication that should be used to access the resource defined in the `operation` property of the [function](#Function-Definition) definitions. If we have the following function definition: The `authRef` property is used to reference an authentication definition in the `auth` property and should be applied when invoking the `helloWorld` function. An [AuthRef](#AuthRef-Definition) object can alternatively be used to configure the authentication definition to use when accessing the function's resource and/or when invoking the function. The `functions` property can be either an in-line [function](#Function-Definition) definition array, or an URI reference to a resource containing an array of [functions](#Function-Definition) definition. Referenced resource can be used by multiple workflow definitions. 1. Workflow definition: 2. Function definitions resource: Referenced resource must conform to the specifications [Workflow Functions JSON Schema](schema/functions.json). The `events` property can be either an in-line [event](#Event-Definition) definition array, or an [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) reference to a resource containing an array of [event](#Event-Definition) definition. Referenced resource can be used by multiple workflow definitions. 2. Event definitions resource: Referenced resource must conform to the specifications [Workflow Events JSON Schema](schema/events.json). The `retries` property can be either an in-line [retry](#Retry-Definition) definition array, or an URI reference to a resource containing an array of [retry](#Retry-Definition) definition. Referenced resource can be used by multiple workflow definitions. For more information about using and referencing retry definitions see the [Workflow Error Handling](#Workflow-Error-Handling) section. The `keepActive` property allows you to change the default behavior of workflow instances. By default, as described in the [Core Concepts](#Core-Concepts) section, a workflow instance is terminated once there are no more active execution paths, one of its active paths ends in a "terminate" [end definition](#End-Definition), or when its [`workflowExecTimeout`](#Workflow-Timeouts) time is reached. Setting the `keepActive` property to `true` allows you to change this default behavior in that a workflow instance created from this workflow definition can only be terminated if one of its active paths ends in a "terminate" [end definition](#End-Definition), or when This allows you to explicitly model workflows where an instance should be kept alive, to collect (event) data for example. You can reference the [specification examples](#Examples) to see the `keepActive` property in action. The `extensions` property can be used to define extensions for this workflow definition. You can learn more about workflow extensions in the [Extensions](#extensions) section. Sample `extensions` property definition could look like this for example: Here we define two workflow extensions, namely the [rate limiting](extensions/ratelimiting.md) and [kpi](extensions/kpi.md) extensions for our workflow definition. Workflow states define building blocks of the Workflow Execution instructions. They define the control flow logic instructions on what the workflow is supposed to do. Serverless Workflow defines the following Workflow States: | Name | Description | Consumes events? | Produces events? | Executes actions? | Handles errors/retries? | Allows parallel execution? | Makes data-based transitions? | Can be workflow start state? | Can be workflow end state? | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **[Event](#Event-State)** | Define events that trigger action execution | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | no | yes | yes | | **[Operation](#Operation-State)** | Execute one or more actions | no | yes | yes | yes | yes | no | yes | yes | | **[Switch](#Switch-State)** | Define data-based or event-based workflow transitions | no | yes | no | yes | no | yes | yes | no | | **[Sleep](#Sleep-State)** | Sleep Workflow Execution for a specific time duration | no | yes | no | yes | no | no | yes | yes | | **[Parallel](#Parallel-State)** | Causes parallel execution of branches (set of states) | no | yes | no | yes | yes | no | yes | yes | | **[Inject](#Inject-State)** | Inject static data into state data | no | yes | no | yes | no | no | yes | yes | | **[ForEach](#ForEach-State)** | Parallel execution of states for each element of a data array | no | yes | no | yes | yes | no | yes | yes | | **[Callback](#Callback-State)** | Manual decision step. Executes a function and waits for callback event that indicates completion of the manual decision | yes | yes | yes | yes | no | no | yes | yes | | name | Unique State name | string | yes | | type | State type | string | yes | | exclusive | If `true`, consuming one of the defined events causes its associated actions to be performed. If `false`, all of the defined events must be consumed in order for actions to be performed. Default is `true` | boolean | no | | [onEvents](#OnEvents-Definition) | Define the events to be consumed and optional actions to be performed | array | yes | | [timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) | State specific timeout settings | object | no | | [stateDataFilter](#State-data-filters) | State data filter definition| object | no | | [transition](#Transitions) | Next transition of the workflow after all the actions have been performed | string or object | yes (if `end` is not defined) | | [onErrors](#Error-Definition) | States error handling definitions | array | no | | [end](#End-Definition) | Is this state an end state | boolean or object | yes (if `transition` is not defined) | | [compensatedBy](#Workflow-Compensation) | Unique name of a workflow state which is responsible for compensation of this state | string | no | | [metadata](#Workflow-Metadata) | Metadata information| object | no | Event states await one or more events and perform actions when they are received. If defined as the workflow starting state, the event state definition controls when the workflow instances should be created. The `exclusive` property determines if the state should wait for any of the defined events in the `onEvents` array, or if all defined events must be present for their associated actions to be performed. Following two figures illustrate the `exclusive` property: <img src="media/spec/event-state-exclusive-true.png" height="300px" alt="Event state with exclusive set to true"/> If the Event state in this case is a workflow starting state, the occurrence of *any* of the defined events would start a new workflow instance. <img src="media/spec/event-state-exclusive-false.png" height="300px" alt="Event state with exclusive set to false"/> If the Event state in this case is a workflow starting state, the occurrence of *all* defined events would start a new workflow instance. In order to consider only events that are related to each other, we need to set the `correlation` property in the workflow [events definitions](#Event-Definition). This allows us to set up event correlation rules against the events extension context attributes. If the Event state is not a workflow starting state, the `timeout` property can be used to define the time duration from the invocation of the event state. If the defined event, or events have not been received during this time, the state should transition to the next state or can end the Workflow Execution (if it is an end state). The `timeouts` property can be used to define state specific timeout settings. Event states can define the `stateExecTimeout`, `actionExecTimeout`, and `eventTimeout` properties. For more information about Event state specific event timeout settings reference [this section](#Event-Timeout-Definition). For more information about workflow timeouts reference the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section. Note that `transition` and `end` properties are mutually exclusive, meaning that you cannot define both of them at the same time. | actionMode | Should actions be performed sequentially or in parallel. Default is `sequential` | enum | no | | [actions](#Action-Definition) | Actions to be performed | array | yes | | [stateDataFilter](#State-data-filters) | State data filter | object | no | | [onErrors](#Error-Definition) | States error handling and retries definitions | array | no | | [usedForCompensation](#Workflow-Compensation) | If `true`, this state is used to compensate another state. Default is `false` | boolean | no | Operation state defines a set of actions to be performed in sequence or in parallel. Once all actions have been performed, a transition to another state can occur. The `timeouts` property can be used to define state specific timeout settings. Operation states can define the `stateExecTimeout` and `actionExecTimeout` settings. For more information on Workflow timeouts reference the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section. | [dataConditions](#Switch-state-Data-Conditions) | Defined if the Switch state evaluates conditions and transitions based on state data. | array | yes (if `eventConditions` is not defined) | | [eventConditions](#Switch-State-Event-Conditions) | Defined if the Switch state evaluates conditions and transitions based on arrival of events. | array | yes (if `dataConditions` is not defined | | defaultCondition | Default transition of the workflow if there is no matching data conditions or event timeout is reached. Can be a transition or end definition | object | yes | Switch states can be viewed as workflow gateways: they can direct transitions of a workflow based on certain conditions. There are two types of conditions for switch states: * [Data-based conditions](#Switch-State-Data-Conditions) * [Event-based conditions](#Switch-State-Event-Conditions) At times multiple defined conditions can be evaluated to `true` by runtime implementations. Conditions defined first take precedence over conditions defined later. This is backed by the fact that arrays/sequences are ordered in both JSON and YAML. For example, let's say there are two `true` conditions: A and B, defined in that order. Because A was defined first, its transition will be executed, not B's. In case of data-based conditions definition, switch state controls workflow transitions based on the states data. If no defined conditions can be matched, the state transitions is taken based on the `defaultCondition` property. This property can be either a `transition` to another workflow state, or an `end` definition meaning a workflow end. For event-based conditions, a switch state acts as a workflow wait state. It halts Workflow Execution until one of the referenced events arrive, then making a transition depending on that event definition. If events defined in event-based conditions do not arrive before the states `eventTimeout` property expires, state transitions are based on the defined `defaultCondition` property. The `timeouts` property can be used to define state specific timeout settings. Switch states can define the `stateExecTimeout` setting. If `eventConditions` is defined, the switch state can also define the `eventTimeout` property. For more information on workflow timeouts reference the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section. | duration | Duration (ISO 8601 duration format) to sleep. For example: "PT15M" (sleep 15 minutes), or "P2DT3H4M" (sleep 2 days, 3 hours and 4 minutes) | string | yes | | [transition](#Transitions) | Next transition of the workflow after the sleep | string or object | yes (if `end` is not defined) | Sleep state suspends Workflow Execution for a given time duration. The delay is defined in its `duration` property using the ISO 8601 duration format. | [branches](#Parallel-State-Branch) | List of branches for this parallel state| array | yes | | completionType | Option types on how to complete branch execution. Default is "allOf" | enum | no | | numCompleted | Used when branchCompletionType is set to `atLeast` to specify the least number of branches that must complete in order for the state to transition/end. | string or number | yes (if `completionType` is `atLeast`) | | [transition](#Transitions) | Next transition of the workflow after all branches have completed execution | string or object | yes (if `end` is not defined) | Parallel state defines a collection of `branches` that are executed in parallel. A parallel state can be seen a state which splits up the current workflow instance execution path into multiple ones, one for each branch. These execution paths are performed in parallel and are joined back into the current execution path depending on the defined `completionType` parameter value. * allOf: All branches must complete execution before the state can transition/end. This is the default value in case this parameter is not defined in the parallel state definition. * atLeast: State can transition/end once at least the specified number of branches have completed execution. In this case you must also specify the `numCompleted` property to define this number. Exceptions may occur during execution of branches of the Parallel state, this is described in detail in [this section](#Parallel-State-Handling-Exceptions). The `timeouts` property can be used to set state specific timeout settings. Parallel states can define the `stateExecTimeout` and `branchExecTimeout` timeout settings. For more information on workflow timeouts reference the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section. | data | JSON object which can be set as state's data input and can be manipulated via filter | object | yes | | [stateDataFilter](#state-data-filters) | State data filter | object | no | | [transition](#Transitions) | Next transition of the workflow after injection has completed | string or object | yes (if `end` is not defined) | Inject state can be used to inject static data into state data input. Inject state does not perform any actions. It is very useful for debugging, for example, as you can test/simulate Workflow Execution with pre-set data that would typically be dynamic in nature (e.g., function calls, events). The inject state `data` property allows you to statically define a JSON object which gets added to the states data input. You can use the filter property to control the states data output to the transition state. Here is a typical example of how to use the inject state to add static data into its states data input, which then is passed as data output to the transition state: ```json "name":"SimpleInjectState", "type":"inject", "data": { "person": { "fname": "John", "lname": "Doe", "address": "1234 SomeStreet", "age": 40 "transition": "GreetPersonState" ``` If the inject state already receives a data input from the previous transition state, the inject data should be merged with its data input. | inputCollection | Workflow expression selecting an array element of the states data | string | yes | | outputCollection | Workflow expression specifying an array element of the states data to add the results of each iteration | string | no | | iterationParam | Name of the iteration parameter that can be referenced in actions/workflow. For each parallel iteration, this param should contain an unique element of the inputCollection array | string | no | | batchSize | Specifies how many iterations may run in parallel at the same time. Used if `mode` property is set to `parallel` (default). If not specified, its value should be the size of the `inputCollection` | string or number | no | | mode | Specifies how iterations are to be performed (sequentially or in parallel). Default is `parallel` | enum | no | | [actions](#Action-Definition) | Actions to be executed for each of the elements of inputCollection | array | yes | | [stateDataFilter](#State-data-filters) | State data filter definition | object | no | | [transition](#Transitions) | Next transition of the workflow after state has completed | string or object | yes (if `end` is not defined) | ForEach states can be used to execute [actions](#Action-Definition) for each element of a data set. Each iteration of the ForEach state is by default executed in parallel by default. However, executing iterations sequentially is also possible by setting the value of the `mode` property to `sequential`. The `mode` property defines if iterations should be done sequentially or in parallel. By default, if `mode` is not specified, iterations should be done in parallel. If the default `parallel` iteration mode is used, the `batchSize` property to the number of iterations (batch) that can be executed at a time. To give an example, if the number of iterations is 55 and `batchSize` is set to `10`, 10 iterations are to be executed at a time, meaning that the state would execute 10 iterations in parallel, then execute the next batch of 10 iterations. After 5 such executions, the remaining 5 iterations are to be executed in the last batch. The batch size value must be greater than 1. If not specified, its value should be the size of the `inputCollection` (all iterations). The `inputCollection` property is a workflow expression which selects an array in the states data. All iterations are performed against data elements of this array. If this array does not exist, the runtime should throw an error. This error can be handled inside the states [`onErrors`](#Error-Definition) definition. The `outputCollection` property is a workflow expression which selects an array in the state data where the results of each iteration should be added to. If this array does not exist, it should be created. The `iterationParam` property defines the name of the iteration parameter passed to each iteration of the ForEach state. It should contain the unique element of the `inputCollection` array and made available to actions of the ForEach state. `iterationParam` can be accessed as an expression variable. [In JQ, expression variables are prefixed by $](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Variable/SymbolicBindingOperator:...as$identifier|...). If `iterationParam` is not explicitly defined, runtimes should create one and populate it with the value of the unique iteration parameter for each iteration of the ForEach state. The `actions` property defines actions to be executed in each state iteration. The workflow data input containing order information is passed to the `SendConfirmState` [ForEach](#ForEach-State) state. The ForEach state defines an `inputCollection` property which selects all orders that have the `completed` property set to `true`. For each element of the array selected by `inputCollection` a JSON object defined by `iterationParam` should be created containing an unique element of `inputCollection` and passed as the data input to the parallel executed actions. So for this example, we would have two parallel executions of the `sendConfirmationFunction`, the first one having data: The results of each parallel action execution are stored as elements in the state data array defined by the `outputCollection` property. The `timeouts` property can be used to set state specific timeout settings. ForEach states can define the `stateExecTimeout` and `actionExecTimeout` settings. For more information on workflow timeouts reference the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section. | [action](#Action-Definition) | Defines the action to be executed | object | yes | | eventRef | References an unique callback event name in the defined workflow [events](#Event-Definition) | string | yes | | [eventDataFilter](#Event-data-filters) | Callback event data filter definition | object | no | | [transition](#Transitions) | Next transition of the workflow after callback event has been received | string or object | yes (if `end` is not defined) | | [compensatedBy](#Workflow-Compensation) | Uniaue name of a workflow state which is responsible for compensation of this state | string | no | Serverless orchestration can at times require manual steps/decisions to be made. While some work performed in a serverless workflow can be executed automatically, some decisions must involve manual steps (e.g., human decisions). The Callback state allows you to explicitly model manual decision steps during Workflow Execution. The action property defines a function call that triggers an external activity/service. Once the action executes, the callback state will wait for a CloudEvent (defined via the `eventRef` property), which indicates the completion of the manual decision by the called service. Note that the called decision service is responsible for emitting the callback CloudEvent indicating the completion of the decision and including the decision results as part of the event payload. This event must be correlated to the workflow instance using the callback events context attribute defined in the `correlation` property of the referenced [Event Definition](#Event-Definition). Once the completion (callback) event is received, the Callback state completes its execution and transitions to the next defined workflow state or completes Workflow Execution in case it is an end state. The `timeouts` property defines state specific timeout settings. Callback states can define the For more information on workflow timeouts reference the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) | name | Unique function name | string | yes | | operation | If type is `rest`, <path_to_openapi_definition>#<operation_id>. If type is `asyncapi`, <path_to_asyncapi_definition>#<operation_id>. If type is `rpc`, <path_to_grpc_proto_file>#<service_name>#<service_method>. If type is `graphql`, <url_to_graphql_endpoint>#<literal \"mutation\" or \"query\">#<query_or_mutation_name>. If type is `odata`, <URI_to_odata_service>#<Entity_Set_Name>. If type is `expression`, defines the workflow expression. | string | yes | | type | Defines the function type. Can be either `rest`, `asyncapi`, `rpc`, `graphql`, `odata`, `expression`, or [`custom`](#defining-custom-function-types). Default is `rest` | enum | no | | authRef | References an [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) name to be used to access to resource defined in the operation parameter | string | no | | [metadata](#Workflow-Metadata) | Metadata information. Can be used to define custom function information | object | no | The `name` property defines an unique name of the function definition. The `type` property defines the function type. Its value can be either `rest` or `expression`. Default value is `rest`. Depending on the function `type`, the `operation` property can be: * If `type` is `rest`, a combination of the function/service OpenAPI definition document URI and the particular service operation that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'. For example `https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json#getPetById`. * If `type` is `asyncapi`, a combination of the AsyncApi definition document URI and the particular service operation that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'. For example `file://streetlightsapi.yaml#onLightMeasured`. * If `type` is `rpc`, a combination of the gRPC proto document URI and the particular service name and service method name that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'. For example `file://myuserservice.proto#UserService#ListUsers`. * If `type` is `graphql`, a combination of the GraphQL schema definition URI and the particular service name and service method name that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'. For example `file://myuserservice.proto#UserService#ListUsers`. * If `type` is `odata`, a combination of the GraphQL schema definition URI and the particular service name and service method name that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'. For example `https://services.odata.org/V3/OData/OData.svc#Products`. * If `type` is `expression`, defines the expression syntax. Take a look at the [workflow expressions section](#Workflow-Expressions) for more information on this. Defining custom function types is possible, for more information on that refer to the [Defining custom function types](#defining-custom-function-types) section. The `authRef` property references a name of a defined workflow [auth definition](#Auth-Definition). It is used to provide authentication info to access the resource defined in the `operation` property and/or to invoke the function. The [`metadata`](#Workflow-Metadata) property allows users to define custom information to function definitions. This allows you for example to define functions that describe of a command executions on a Docker image: Function definitions themselves do not define data input parameters. Parameters can be defined via the `parameters` property in [function definitions](#FunctionRef-Definition) inside [actions](#Action-Definition). | resource | References an auth definition to be used to access the resource defined in the operation parameter | string | yes | | invocation | References an auth definition to be used to invoke the operation | string | no | The `authRef` property references a name of a defined workflow [auth definition](#Auth-Definition). It can be a string or an object. If it's a string, the referenced [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) is used solely for the function's invocation. If it's an object, it is possible to specify an [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) to use for the function's resource retrieval (as defined by the `operation` property) and another for its invocation. Example of a function definition configured to use an [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) called "My Basic Auth" upon invocation: Example of a function definition configured to use an [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) called "My Basic Auth" to retrieve the resource defined by the `operation` property, and an [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) called "My OIDC Auth" upon invocation: Note that if multiple functions share the same `operation` path (*which is the first component of the operation value, located before the first '#' character*), and if one of them defines an [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) for resource access, then it should always be used to access said resource. In other words, when retrieving the resource of the function "MySecuredFunction2" defined in the following example, the "My Api Key Auth" [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) should be used, because the "MySecuredFunction1" has defined it for resource access. This is done to avoid unnecessary repetitions of [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) configuration when using the same resource for multiple defined functions. It's worth noting that if an [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) has been defined for an OpenAPI function which's resource declare an authentication mechanism, the later should be used instead, thus ignoring entirely the [auth definition](#Auth-Definition). | name | Unique event name | string | yes | | source | CloudEvent source. If not set when `kind` is `produced`, runtimes are expected to use a default value, such as https://serverlessworkflow.io in order to comply with the [CloudEvent spec constraints](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/spec.md#source-1))| string | yes (if `type` is not defined. | | type | CloudEvent type | string | yes (if `source` is not defined) | | kind | Defines the event is either `consumed` or `produced` by the workflow. Default is `consumed` | enum | no | | [correlation](#Correlation-Definition) | Define event correlation rules for this event. Only used for consumed events | array | no | | dataOnly | If `true` (default value), only the Event payload is accessible to consuming Workflow states. If `false`, both event payload and context attributes should be accessible | boolean | no | Used to define events and their correlations. These events can be either consumed or produced during Workflow Execution as well as can be used to [trigger function/service invocations](#EventRef-Definition). The Serverless Workflow specification mandates that all events conform to the [CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec) specification. This is to assure consistency and portability of the events format used. The `name` property defines a single name of the event that is unique inside the workflow definition. This event name can be then referenced within [function](#Function-Definition) and [state](#Workflow-States) definitions. The `source` property matches this event definition with the [source](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md#source-1) property of the CloudEvent required attributes. The `type` property matches this event definition with the [type](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md#type) property of the CloudEvent required attributes. The `kind` property defines this event as either `consumed` or `produced`. In terms of the workflow, this means it is either an event that triggers workflow instance creation, or continuation of workflow instance execution (consumed), or an event that the workflow instance creates during its execution (produced). The default value (if not specified) of the `kind` property is `consumed`. Note that for `produced` event definitions, implementations must provide the value of the CloudEvent source attribute. In this case (i.e., when the `kind` property is set to `produced`), the `source` property of the event is not required in the workflow definition. Otherwise, (i.e., when the `kind` property is set to `consumed`), the `source` property must be defined in the event definition. Event correlation plays a big role in large event-driven applications. Correlating one or more events with a particular workflow instance can be done by defining the event correlation rules within the `correlation` property. This property is an array of [correlation](#Correlation-Definition) definitions. The CloudEvents specification allows users to add [Extension Context Attributes](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md#extension-context-attributes) and the correlation definitions can use these attributes to define clear matching event correlation rules. Extension context attributes are not part of the event payload, so they are serialized the same way as other standard required attributes. This means that the event payload does not have to be inspected by implementations in order to read and evaluate the defined correlation rules. Let's take a look at an example. Here we have two events that have an extension context attribute called "patientId" (as well as "department", which will be used in further examples below): We can then define a correlation rule, through which all consumed events with the "hospitalMonitorSystem", and the "com.hospital.patient.heartRateMonitor" type that have the **same** value of the `patientId` property to be correlated to the created workflow instance: If a workflow instance is created (e.g., via Event state) by consuming a "HeartRateReadingEvent" event, all other consumed events from the defined source and with the defined type that have the same "patientId" as the event that triggered the workflow instance should then also be associated with the same instance. You can also correlate multiple events together. In the following example, we assume that the workflow consumes two different event types, and we want to make sure that both are correlated, as in the above example, with the same "patientId": Event correlation can be based on equality (values of the defined "contextAttributeName" must be equal), but it can also be based on comparing it to custom defined values (string, or expression). For example: In this example, we have two correlation rules defined: The first one is on the "patientId" CloudEvent context attribute, meaning again that all consumed events from this source and type must have the same "patientId" to be considered. The second rule says that these events must all have a context attribute named "department" with the value of "UrgentCare". This allows developers to write orchestration workflows that are specifically targeted to patients that are in the hospital urgent care unit, for example. The `dataOnly` property deals with what Event data is accessible by the consuming Workflow states. If its value is `true` (default value), only the Event payload is accessible to consuming Workflow states. If `false`, both Event payload and context attributes should be accessible. Auth definitions can be used to define authentication information that should be applied to [function definitions](#Function-Definition). It can be used for both the retrieval of the function's resource (as defined by the `operation` property) and for the function's invocation. | name | Unique auth definition name | string | yes | | scheme | Auth scheme, can be "basic", "bearer", or "oauth2". Default is "basic" | enum | no | | properties | Auth scheme properties. Can be one of ["Basic properties definition"](#basic-properties-definition), ["Bearer properties definition"](#bearer-properties-definition), or ["OAuth2 properties definition"](#oauth2-properties-definition) | object | yes | The `name` property defines the unique auth definition name. The `scheme` property defines the auth scheme to be used. Can be "bearer", "basic" or "oauth2". The `properties` property defines the auth scheme properties information. Can be one of ["Basic properties definition"](#basic-properties-definition), ["Bearer properties definition"](#bearer-properties-definition), or ["OAuth2 properties definition"](#oauth2-properties-definition) See [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication#basic_authentication_scheme) for more information about Basic Authentication scheme. The Basic properties definition can have two types, either `string` or `object`. If `string` type, it defines a [workflow expression](#workflow-expressions) that contains all needed Basic auth information. If `object` type, it has the following properties: | username | String or a workflow expression. Contains the user name | string | yes | | password | String or a workflow expression. Contains the user password | string | yes | See [here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) for more information about Bearer Authentication scheme. | token | String or a workflow expression. Contains the token information | string | yes | See [here](https://oauth.net/2/) for more information about OAuth2 Authentication scheme. | authority | String or a workflow expression. Contains the authority information | string | no | | grantType | Defines the grant type. Can be "password", "clientCredentials", or "tokenExchange" | enum | yes | | clientId | String or a workflow expression. Contains the client identifier | string | yes | | clientSecret | Workflow secret or a workflow expression. Contains the client secret | string | no | | scopes | Array containing strings or workflow expressions. Contains the OAuth2 scopes | array | no | | username | String or a workflow expression. Contains the user name. Used only if grantType is 'resourceOwner' | string | no | | password | String or a workflow expression. Contains the user password. Used only if grantType is 'resourceOwner' | string | no | | audiences | Array containing strings or workflow expressions. Contains the OAuth2 audiences | array | no | | subjectToken | String or a workflow expression. Contains the subject token | string | no | | requestedSubject | String or a workflow expression. Contains the requested subject | string | no | | requestedIssuer | String or a workflow expression. Contains the requested issuer | string | no | | contextAttributeName | CloudEvent Extension Context Attribute name | string | yes | | contextAttributeValue | CloudEvent Extension Context Attribute value | string | no | Used to define event correlation rules. Only usable for `consumed` event definitions. The `contextAttributeName` property defines the name of the CloudEvent [extension context attribute](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md#extension-context-attributes). The `contextAttributeValue` property defines the value of the defined CloudEvent [extension context attribute](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md#extension-context-attributes). | eventRefs | References one or more unique event names in the defined workflow [events](#Event-Definition) | array | yes | | actionMode | Specifies how actions are to be performed (in sequence or in parallel). Default is `sequential` | enum | no | | [actions](#Action-Definition) | Actions to be performed | array | no | | [eventDataFilter](#Event-data-filters) | Event data filter definition | object | no | OnEvent definition allow you to define which [actions](#Action-Definition) are to be performed for the one or more [events definitions](#Event-Definition) defined in the `eventRefs` array. Note that the values of `eventRefs` array must be unique. The `actionMode` property defines if the defined actions need to be performed sequentially or in parallel. The `actions` property defines a list of actions to be performed. When specifying the `onEvents` definition it is important to consider the Event states `exclusive` property, because it determines how 'onEvents' is interpreted. Let's look at the following JSON definition of 'onEvents' to show this: "onEvents": [{ "eventRefs": ["HighBodyTemperature", "HighBloodPressure"], "actions": [{ "functionRef": { "refName": "SendTylenolOrder", "arguments": { "patient": "${ .patientId }" } } }, { "refName": "CallNurse", } ] }] Depending on the value of the Event states `exclusive` property, this definition can mean two different things: 1. If `exclusive` is set to `true`, the consumption of **either** the `HighBodyTemperature` or `HighBloodPressure` events will trigger action execution. 2. If `exclusive` is set to `false`, the consumption of **both** the `HighBodyTemperature` and `HighBloodPressure` events will trigger action execution. <img src="media/spec/event-state-onevents-example.png" height="300px" alt="Event onEvents example"/> | name | Unique Action name | string | no | | [functionRef](#FunctionRef-Definition) | References a reusable function definition | object or string | yes (if `eventRef` & `subFlowRef` are not defined) | | [eventRef](#EventRef-Definition) | References a `produce` and `consume` reusable event definitions | object | yes (if `functionRef` & `subFlowRef` are not defined) | | [subFlowRef](#SubFlowRef-Definition) | References a workflow to be invoked | object or string | yes (if `eventRef` & `functionRef` are not defined) | | [retryRef](#retry-definition) | References a defined workflow retry definition. If not defined uses the default runtime retry definition | string | no | | nonRetryableErrors | List of references to defined [workflow errors](#Defining-Errors) for which the action should not be retried. Used only when `autoRetries` is set to `true` | array | no | | retryableErrors | List of references to defined [workflow errors](#Defining-Errors) for which the action should be retried. Used only when `autoRetries` is set to `false` | array | no | | [actionDataFilter](#Action-data-filters) | Action data filter definition | object | no | | sleep | Defines time periods Workflow Execution should sleep before / after function execution | object | no | | [condition](#Workflow-Expressions) | Expression, if defined, must evaluate to `true` for this action to be performed. If `false`, action is disregarded | string | no | Actions specify invocations of services or other workflows during Workflow Execution. Service invocation can be done in three different ways: * Reference [functions definitions](#Function-Definition) by its unique name using the `functionRef` property. * Reference a `produced` and `consumed` [event definitions](#Event-Definition) via the `eventRef` property. * Reference a sub-workflow invocation via the `subFlowRef` property. Note that `functionRef`, `eventRef`, and `subFlowRef` are mutually exclusive, meaning that only one of them can be specified in a single action definition. The `name` property specifies the action name. In the event-based scenario a service, or a set of services we want to invoke are not exposed via a specific resource URI for example, but can only be invoked via an event. The [eventRef](#EventRef-Definition) property defines the referenced `produced` event via its `produceEventRef` property and a `consumed` event via its `consumeEventRef` property. The `sleep` property can be used to define time periods that Workflow Execution should sleep before and/or after function execution. It can have two properties: * `before` - defines the amount of time (ISO 8601 duration format) to sleep before function invocation. * `after` - defines the amount of time (ISO 8601 duration format) to sleep after function invocation. Function invocation timeouts should be handled via the states [timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) definition. The `retryRef` property references one of the defined workflow retries by it's unique name. If not set, the action should be retried according to the default retry policy of the runtime implementation. For more information about workflow retries reference [this section](#retry-definition). The `nonRetryableErrors` property is a list that references one or more unique names of workflow error definitions. This is the list of known errors for which the action should not be retried for. It should be used only when the workflow top-level `autoRetries` property is set to `true`. The `retryableErrors` property is a list that references one or more unique names of workflow error definitions. This is the list of known errors for which the action should be retried for. It should be used only when the workflow top-level `autoRetries` property is set to `false`. The `condition` property is a [workflow expression](#Workflow-Expressions). If defined, it must evaluate to `true` for this action to be performed. If it evaluates to `false` the action is skipped. If the `condition` property is not defined, the action is always performed. Often you want to group your workflows into small logical units that solve a particular business problem and can be reused in multiple other workflow definitions. <img src="media/spec/subflowstateref.png" height="350px" alt="Referencing reusable workflow via SubFlow actions"/> Reusable workflows are referenced by their `id` property via the SubFlow action `workflowId` parameter. For the simple case, `subFlowRef` can be a string containing the `id` of the sub-workflow to invoke. If you want to specify other parameters then a [subFlowRef](#SubFlowRef-Definition) should be provided instead. Referenced sub-workflows must declare their own [function](#Function-Definition) and [event](#Event-Definition) definitions. `FunctionRef` definition can have two types, either `string` or `object`. If `string` type, it defines the name of the referenced [function](#Function-Definition). This can be used as a short-cut definition when you don't need to define any other parameters, for example: Note that if used with `string` type, the invocation of the function is synchronous. If you need to define parameters in your `functionRef` definition, you can define it with its `object` type which has the following properties: | refName | Name of the referenced [function](#Function-Definition) | string | yes | | arguments | Arguments (inputs) to be passed to the referenced function | object | yes (if function type is `graphql`, otherwise no) | | selectionSet | Used if function type is `graphql`. String containing a valid GraphQL [selection set](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Selection-Sets) | string | yes (if function type is `graphql`, otherwise no) | | invoke | Specifies if the function should be invoked `sync` or `async`. Default is `sync` | enum | no | The `refName` property is the name of the referenced [function](#Function-Definition). The `arguments` property defines the arguments that are to be passed to the referenced function. Here is an example of using the `arguments` property: The `invoke` property defines how the function is invoked (sync or async). Default value of this property is `sync`, meaning that Workflow Execution should wait until the function completes. If set to `async`, Workflow Execution should just invoke the function and should not wait until its completion. Note that in this case the action does not produce any results and the associated actions actionDataFilter as well as its retry definition, if defined, should be ignored. In addition, functions that are invoked async do not propagate their errors to the associated action definition and the workflow state, meaning that any errors that happen during their execution cannot be handled in the workflow states onErrors definition. Note that errors raised during functions that are invoked async should not fail Workflow Execution. Allows defining invocation of a function via event. | [produceEventRef](#Event-Definition) | Reference to the unique name of a `produced` event definition | string | yes | | [consumeEventRef](#Event-Definition) | Reference to the unique name of a `consumed` event definition | string | no | | consumeEventTimeout | Maximum amount of time (ISO 8601 format) to wait for the consume event. If not defined it be set to the [actionExecutionTimeout](#Workflow-Timeout-Definition) | string | no | | data | If string type, an expression which selects parts of the states data output to become the data (payload) of the event referenced by `produceEventRef`. If object type, a custom object to become the data (payload) of the event referenced by `produceEventRef`. | string or object | no | | contextAttributes | Add additional event extension context attributes to the trigger/produced event | object | no | | invoke | Specifies if the function should be invoked sync or async. Default is sync | enum | no | References a `produced` and `consumed` [event definitions](#Event-Definition) via the `produceEventRef` and `consumeEventRef` properties, respectively. The `data` property can have two types: string or object. If it is of string type, it is an expression that can select parts of state data to be used as payload of the event referenced by `produceEventRef`. If it is of object type, you can define a custom object to be the event payload. The `contextAttributes` property allows you to add one or more [extension context attributes](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md#extension-context-attributes) to the trigger/produced event. The `consumeEventTimeout` property defines the maximum amount of time (ISO 8601 format) to wait for the result event. If not defined it should default to the [actionExecutionTimeout](#Workflow-Timeout-Definition). If the event defined by the `consumeEventRef` property is not received in that set time, action invocation should raise an error that can be handled in the states `onErrors` definition. In case the `consumeEventRef` is not defined, the `consumeEventTimeout` property is ignored. `sync`, meaning that Workflow Execution should wait until the function completes (the result event is received). If set to `async`, Workflow Execution should just produce the trigger event and should not wait for the result event. Note that in this case the action does not produce any results (payload of the result event) and the associated actions eventDataFilter as well as Functions that are invoked via events (sync or async) do not propagate their errors to the associated action definition and the workflow state, meaning that any errors that happen during their execution cannot be handled in the workflow states onErrors definition. Note that errors raised during functions that are invoked sync or async in this case should not fail Workflow Execution. `SubFlowRef` definition can have two types, namely `string` or `object`. If `string` type, it defines the unique id of the sub-workflow to be invoked. This short-hand definition can be used if sub-workflow lookup is done only by its `id` property and not its `version` property. If you need to define the `version` properties, you can use its `object` type: | workflowId | Sub-workflow unique id | string | yes | | version | Sub-workflow version | string | no | | invoke | Specifies if the subflow should be invoked `sync` or `async`. Default is `sync` | enum | no | | onParentComplete | If `invoke` is `async`, specifies if subflow execution should `terminate` or `continue` when parent workflow completes. Default is `terminate` | enum | no | The `workflowId` property define the unique ID of the sub-workflow to be invoked. Usually, the workflow id should not be the same id of the workflow where the action is defined. Otherwise, it may occur undesired recurring calls to the same workflow. The `version` property defined the unique version of the sub-workflow to be invoked. If this property is defined, runtimes should match both the `id` and the `version` properties defined in the sub-workflow definition. The `invoke` property defines how the subflow is invoked (sync or async). Default value of this property is `sync`, meaning that Workflow Execution should wait until the subflow completes. If set to `async`, Workflow Execution should just invoke the subflow and not wait for its results. Note that in this case the action does not produce any results, and the associated actions actionDataFilter as well as Subflows that are invoked async do not propagate their errors to the associated action definition and the onErrors definition. Note that errors raised during subflows that are invoked async The `onParentComplete` property defines how subflow execution that is invoked async should behave if the parent workflow completes execution before the subflow completes its own execution. The default value of this property is `terminate`, meaning that if the parent workflow (the workflow that invoked the subflow) completes, execution of the subflow should be terminated. If it is set to `continue`, if the parent workflow completes, the subflow execution is allowed to continue its own execution. | errorRef or errorRefs | Reference one unique workflow error definition, or multiple unique workflow error definitions | string (errorRef) or array (errorRefs) | yes | | [transition](#Transitions) | Transition to next state to handle the error | string or object | yes (if `end` is not defined) | | [end](#End-Definition) | End Workflow Execution if this error is encountered | boolean or object | yes (if `transition` is not defined) | The `errorRef` property references the unique workflow error definition. For more info on workflow error handling referece [this section](#Defining-Errors). The `errorRefs`property references at least one of the defined workflow error definitions. Can be used when `errorRef` is not used. Usable when you want to define multiple error refs for which the same transition or end definition should be applied.For more info on workflow error handling Note that the `errorRef` and `errorRefs` properties are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can only specify one or the other, but not both at the same time. The `transition` property defines the transition to the next workflow state in cases when the defined error happens during runtime execution. If `transition` is not defined you can also define the `end` property which will end Workflow Execution at that point. Note that the `transition` and `end` properties are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can only specify one or the other, For more information, see the [Workflow Error Handling](#Workflow-Error-Handling) sections. | name | Unique retry strategy name | string | yes | | delay | Time delay between retry attempts (ISO 8601 duration format) | string | no | | maxAttempts | Maximum number of retry attempts. Value of 1 means no retries are performed | string or number | yes | | maxDelay | Maximum amount of delay between retry attempts (ISO 8601 duration format) | string | no | | increment | Static duration which will be added to the delay between successive retries (ISO 8601 duration format) | string | no | | multiplier | Float value by which the delay is multiplied before each attempt. For example: "1.2" meaning that each successive delay is 20% longer than the previous delay. For example, if delay is 'PT10S', then the delay between the first and second attempts will be 10 seconds, and the delay before the third attempt will be 12 seconds. | float or string | no | | jitter | If float type, maximum amount of random time added or subtracted from the delay between each retry relative to total delay (between 0.0 and 1.0). If string type, absolute maximum amount of random time added or subtracted from the delay between each retry (ISO 8601 duration format) | float or string | no | Defines the states retry policy (strategy). This is an explicit definition and can be reused across multiple defined state [actions](#Action-Definition). The `name` property specifies the unique name of the retry definition (strategy). This unique name can be referred by workflow states [error definitions](#Error-Definition). The `delay` property specifies the initial time delay between retry attempts (ISO 8601 duration format). The `increment` property specifies a static duration which will be added to the delay between successive retries. which means that we will retry up to 4 times after waiting with increasing delay between attempts; in this example 10, 12, 14, and 16 seconds between retries. The `multiplier` property specifies the value by which the interval time is increased for each of the retry attempts. in this example 10, 20, 40, and 80 seconds between retries. If both `increment` and `multiplier` properties are defined, `increment` should be applied first and then the `multiplier` when determining the next retry time. The `maxAttempts` property determines the maximum number of retry attempts allowed and is a positive integer value. The `jitter` property is important to prevent certain scenarios where clients are retrying in sync, possibly causing or contributing to a transient failure precisely because they're retrying at the same time. Adding a typically small, bounded random amount of time to the period between retries serves the purpose of attempting to prevent these retries from happening simultaneously, possibly reducing total time to complete requests and overall congestion. How this value is used in the exponential backoff algorithm is left up to implementations. `jitter` may be specified as a percentage relative to the total delay. Once the next retry attempt delay is calculated, we can apply `jitter` as a percentage value relative to this calculated delay. For example, if your calculated delay for the next retry is six seconds, and we specify a `jitter` value of 0.3, a random amount of time between 0 and 1.8 (0.3 times 6) is to be added or subtracted from the calculated delay. Alternatively, `jitter` may be defined as an absolute value specified as an ISO 8601 duration. This way, the maximum amount of random time added is fixed and will not increase as new attempts are made. The `maxDelay` property determines the maximum amount of delay that is desired between retry attempts, and is applied after `increment`, `multiplier`, and `jitter`. in this example we might observe the following series of delays: * 11s (min(`maxDelay`, (`delay` +/- rand(`jitter`)) => min(100, 10 + 1)) * 43s (min(`maxDelay`, (11s * `multiplier`) +/- rand(`jitter`)) => min(100, (11 * 4) - 1)) * 100s (min(`maxDelay`, (43s * `multiplier`) +/- rand(`jitter`)) => min(100, (43 * 4) + 0)) * 100s (min(`maxDelay`, (100s * `multiplier`) +/- rand(`jitter`)) => min(100, (100 * 4) - 1)) `Transition` definition can have two types, either `string` or `object`. If `string`, it defines the name of the state to transition to. If you need to define additional parameters in your `transition` definition, you can define | [nextState](#Transitions) | Name of the state to transition to next | string | yes | | [compensate](#Workflow-Compensation) | If set to `true`, triggers workflow compensation before this transition is taken. Default is `false` | boolean | no | | produceEvents | Array of [producedEvent](#ProducedEvent-Definition) definitions. Events to be produced before the transition takes place | array | no | The `nextState` property defines the name of the state to transition to next. The `compensate` property allows you to trigger [compensation](#Workflow-Compensation) before the transition (if set to `true`). The `produceEvents` property allows you to define a list of events to produce before the transition happens. Transitions allow you to move from one state (control-logic block) to another. For more information see the [Transitions section](#Transitions) section. | name | Data condition name | string | no | | [condition](#Workflow-Expressions) | Workflow expression evaluated against state data. Must evaluate to `true` or `false` | string | yes | | [transition](#Transitions) | Transition to another state if condition is `true` | string or object | yes (if `end` is not defined) | | [end](#End-Definition) | End Workflow Execution if condition is `true` | boolean or object | yes (if `transition` is not defined) | Switch state data conditions specify a data-based condition statement, which causes a transition to another workflow state if evaluated to `true`. The `condition` property of the condition defines an expression (e.g., `${ .applicant | .age > 18 }`), which selects parts of the state data input. The condition must evaluate to `true` or `false`. If the condition is evaluated to `true`, you can specify either the `transition` or `end` definitions to decide what to do, transition to another workflow state, or end Workflow Execution. Note that `transition` and `end` definitions are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can specify either one or the other, but not both. | name | Event condition name | string | no | | eventRef | References an unique event name in the defined workflow events | string | yes | Switch state event conditions specify events, which the switch state must wait for. Each condition can reference one workflow-defined event. Upon arrival of this event, the associated transition is taken. The `eventRef` property references a name of one of the defined workflow events. If the referenced event is received, you can specify either the `transition` or `end` definitions to decide what to do, transition to another workflow state, or end Workflow Execution. The `eventDataFilter` property can be used to filter event data when it is received. Note that `transition` and `end` | name | Branch name | string | yes | | [actions](#Action-Definition) | Actions to be executed in this branch | array | yes | | [timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) | Branch specific timeout settings | object | no | A branch can define actions that need to be executed. For the [`SubFlowRef`](#SubFlowRef-Definition) action, the workflow id should not be the same id of the workflow where the branch is defined. Otherwise, it may occur undesired recurring calls to the same workflow. The `timeouts` property can be used to set branch specific timeout settings. Parallel state branches can set the `actionExecTimeout` and `branchExecTimeout` timeout properties. For more information on workflow timeouts reference the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section. By default, exceptions that are not handled within branches stop branch execution and are propagated to the Parallel state and should be handled with its `onErrors` definition. If the parallel states branch defines actions, all exceptions that arise from executing these actions (after all allotted retries are exhausted) are propagated to the parallel state and can be handled with the parallel states `onErrors` definition. If the parallel states defines a subflow action, exceptions that occur during execution of the called workflow can choose to handle exceptions on their own. All unhandled exceptions from the called workflow execution however are propagated back to the parallel state and can be handled with the parallel states `onErrors` definition. Note that once an error that is propagated to the parallel state from a branch and handled by the states `onErrors` definition is handled (its associated transition is taken) no further errors from branches of this parallel state should be considered as the workflow control flow logic has already moved to a different state. Can be either `string` or `object` type. If type string, it defines the name of the workflow starting state. In this case it's assumed that the `schedule` property is not defined. If the start definition is of type `object`, it has the following structure: | stateName | Name of the starting workflow state | string | no | | [schedule](#Schedule-Definition) | Define the recurring time intervals or cron expressions at which workflow instances should be automatically started. | string or object | yes | The start definition can be either `string` or `object` type. If `string` type, it defines the name of the workflow starting state. If `object` type, it provides the ability to set the workflow starting state name, as well as the `schedule` property. The `stateName` property can be set to define the starting workflow state. If not specified, the first state in the [workflow states definition](#Workflow-States) should be used as the starting workflow state. The `schedule` property allows to define scheduled workflow instance creation. Scheduled starts have two different choices. You can define a recurring time interval or cron-based schedule at which a workflow instance **should** be created (automatically). You can also define cron-based scheduled starts, which allows you to specify periodically started workflow instances based on a [cron](http://crontab.org/) definition. Cron-based scheduled starts can handle absolute time intervals (i.e., not calculated in respect to some particular point in time). One use case for cron-based scheduled starts is a workflow that performs periodical data batch processing. In this case we could use a cron definition ``` text [See here](http://crontab.org/) to get more information on defining cron expressions. One thing to discuss when dealing with cron-based scheduled starts is when the workflow starting state is an [Event](#Event-State). Event states define that workflow instances are triggered by the existence of the defined event(s). Defining a cron-based scheduled starts for the runtime implementations would mean that there needs to be an event service that issues the needed events at the defined times to trigger workflow instance creation. Defining a start definition is not required. If it's not defined, the starting workflow state has to be the very first state defined in the [workflow states array](#Workflow-States). `Schedule` definition can have two types, either `string` or `object`. If `string` type, it defines time interval describing when the workflow instance should be automatically created. If you need to define the `cron` or the `timezone` parameters in your `schedule` definition, you can define | interval | A recurring time interval expressed in the derivative of ISO 8601 format specified below. Declares that workflow instances should be automatically created at the start of each time interval in the series. | string | yes (if `cron` is not defined) | | [cron](#Cron-Definition) | Cron expression defining when workflow instances should be automatically created | object | yes (if `interval` is not defined) | | timezone | Timezone name used to evaluate the interval & cron-expression. If the interval specifies a date-time w/ timezone then proper timezone conversion will be applied. (default: UTC). | string | no | The `interval` property uses a derivative of ISO 8601 recurring time interval format to describe a series of consecutive time intervals for workflow instances to be automatically created at the start of. Unlike full ISO 8601, this derivative format does not allow expression of an explicit number of recurrences or identification of a series by the date and time at the start and end of its first time interval. There are three ways to express a recurring interval: 1. `R/<Start>/<Duration>`: Defines the start time and a duration, for example: "R/2020-03-20T13:00:00Z/PT2H", meaning workflow instances will be automatically created every 2 hours starting from March 20th 2020 at 1pm UTC. 2. `R/<Duration>/<End>`: Defines a duration and an end, for example: "R/PT2H/2020-05-11T15:30:00Z", meaning that workflow instances will be automatically created every 2 hours until until May 11th 2020 at 3:30pm UTC (i.e., the last instance will be created 2 hours prior to that, at 1:30pm UTC). 3. `R/<Duration>`: Defines a duration only, for example: "R/PT2H", meaning workflow instances will be automatically created every 2 hours. The start time of the first interval may be indeterminate, but should be delayed by no more than the specified duration and must repeat on schedule after that (this is effectively supplying the start time "out-of-band" as permitted ISO ISO 8601-1:2019 section 5.6.1 NOTE 1). Each runtime implementation should document how the start time for a duration-only interval is established. The `cron` property uses a [cron expression](http://crontab.org/) to describe a repeating interval upon which a workflow instance should be created automatically. For more information see the [cron definition](#Cron-Definition) section. The `timezone` property is used to define a time zone name to evaluate the cron or interval expression against. If not specified, it should default to UTC time zone. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) for a list of timezone names. For ISO 8601 date time values in `interval` or `cron.validUntil`, runtimes should treat `timezone` as the 'local time' (UTC if `timezone` is not defined by the user). Note that when the workflow starting state is an [Event](#Event-State) defining cron-based scheduled starts for the runtime implementations would mean that there needs to be an event service that issues `Cron` definition can have two types, either `string` or `object`. If `string` type, it defines the cron expression describing when the workflow instance should be created (automatically). If you need to define the `validUntil` parameters in your `cron` definition, you can define | expression | Cron expression describing when the workflow instance should be created (automatically) | string | yes | | validUntil | Specific date and time (ISO 8601 format) when the cron expression is no longer valid | string | no | The `expression` property is a a [cron expression](http://crontab.org/) which defines when workflow instances should be created (automatically). The `validUntil` property defines a date and time (using ISO 8601 format). When the `validUntil` time is reached, the cron expression for instances creations of this workflow should no longer be valid. This tells the runtime engine to create an instance of this workflow every hour at minutes 15, 30 and 45. This is to be done until November 5, 2021, 8:15:30 am, US Eastern Standard Time as defined by the `validUntil` property value. Can be either `boolean` or `object` type. If type boolean, must be set to `true`, for example: In this case it's assumed that the `terminate` property has its default value of `false`, and the `produceEvents`, `compensate`, and `continueAs` properties are not defined. If the end definition is of type `object`, it has the following structure: | terminate | If `true`. terminates workflow instance execution | boolean | no | | produceEvents | Array of [producedEvent](#ProducedEvent-Definition) definitions. Defines events that should be produced. | array | no | | [compensate](#Workflow-Compensation) | If set to `true`, triggers workflow compensation before Workflow Execution completes. Default is `false` | boolean | no | | [continueAs](#continuing-as-a-new-execution) | Defines that current Workflow Execution should stop, and execution should continue as a new workflow instance of the provided id | string or object | no | End definitions are used to explicitly define execution completion of a workflow instance or Workflow Execution path. A workflow definition must include at least one [workflow state](#Workflow-States). Note that [Switch states](#Switch-State) cannot declare to be workflow end states. Their conditions however can define a stop of Workflow Execution. The `terminate` property, if set to `true`, completes the workflow instance execution, this any other active execution paths. If a terminate end is reached inside a ForEach or Parallel state the entire workflow instance is terminated. The [`produceEvents`](#ProducedEvent-Definition) allows defining events which should be produced by the workflow instance before workflow stops its execution. It's important to mention that if the workflow `keepActive` property is set to`true`, the only way to complete execution of the workflow instance is if Workflow Execution reaches a state that defines an end definition with `terminate` property set to `true`, or, if the [`workflowExecTimeout`](#Workflow-Timeouts) property is defined, the time defined in its `interval` is reached. The [compensate](#Workflow-Compensation) property defines that workflow compensation should be performed before the workflow execution is completed. The [continueAs](#Continuing-as-a-new-Execution) property defines that the current workflow instance should stop its execution, and worklow execution should continue as a new instance of a new workflow. When defined, it should be assumed that `terminate` is `true`. If `continueAs` is defined, and `terminate` is explicitly set to `false`, runtimes should report this to users. Producing events, and compensation should still be performed (if defined) before the Workflow Execution is stopped, and continued as a new workflow instance with the defined workflow id. | eventRef | Reference to a defined unique event name in the [events](#Event-Definition) definition | string | yes | | data | If string type, an expression which selects parts of the states data output to become the data (payload) of the produced event. If object type, a custom object to become the data (payload) of produced event. | string or object | no | | contextAttributes | Add additional event extension context attributes | object | no | Defines the event (CloudEvent format) to be produced when Workflow Execution completes or during a workflow [transitions](#Transitions). The `eventRef` property must match the name of one of the defined `produced` events in the [events](#Event-Definition) definition. The `data` property can have two types, object or string. If of string type, it is an expression that can select parts of state data to be used as the event payload. If of object type, you can define a custom object to be the event payload. to the generated event. Being able to produce events when Workflow Execution completes or during state transition allows for event-based orchestration communication. For example, completion of an orchestration workflow can notify other orchestration workflows to decide if they need to act upon the produced event, or notify monitoring services of the current state of Workflow Execution, etc. It can be used to create very dynamic orchestration scenarios. Serverless workflow states can have one or more incoming and outgoing transitions (from/to other states). Each state can define a `transition` definition that is used to determine which state to transition to next. Implementers **must** use the unique State `name` property for determining the transition. Events can be produced during state transitions. The `produceEvents` property of the `transition` definitions allows you to reference one or more defined `produced` events in the workflow [events definitions](#Event-Definition). For each of the produced events you can select what parts of state data to be the event payload. Transitions can trigger compensation via their `compensate` property. See the [Workflow Compensation](#Workflow-Compensation) section for more information. Specifying additional properties, namely properties which are not defined by the specification are only allowed in the [Workflow Definition](#Workflow-Definition-Structure). Additional properties serve the same purpose as [Workflow Metadata](#Workflow-Metadata). They allow you to enrich the workflow definition with custom information. Additional properties, just like workflow metadata, should not affect Workflow Execution. Implementations may choose to use additional properties or ignore them. In this example, we specify the `loglevel`, `environment`, and `category` additional properties. Serverless Workflow language allows you to define `explicit` error handling, meaning you can define what should happen in case of errors inside your workflow model rather than some generic error handling entity. This allows error handling to become part of your orchestration activities and as such part of your business problem solutions. The idea behind the way Serverless Workflow defines error handling is that workflows should only fail due to unknown bugs during execution. In general, you should always write your workflows so that they do not fail on any known failures. Each workflow state can define error handling, which is related only to errors that may arise during its execution. Error handling defined in one state cannot be used to handle errors that happened during execution of another state during Workflow Execution. Unknown errors that may arise during workflow state execution that are not explicitly handled within the workflow definition should be reported by runtime implementations and halt Workflow Execution. Within workflow definitions, errors defined are `domain specific`, meaning they are defined within the actual business domain, rather than their technical (programming-language-specific) description. For example, we can define errors such as "Order not found", or "Item not in inventory", rather than having to use terms such as "java.lang.IllegalAccessError", or "response.status == 404", which might make little to no sense to our specific problem domain, as well as may not be portable across various runtime implementations. In addition to the domain specific error name, users have the option to also add an optional error code to help runtime implementations with mapping defined errors to concrete underlying technical ones. Runtime implementations must be able to map the error domain specific name (and the optional error code) to concrete technical errors that arise during Workflow Execution. Known workflow errors, that we know we need to handle during Workflow Execution should be defined in the workflow top-level 'errors' property. This property can be either a string type, meaning it can reference a reusable JSON or Yaml definition file including the error definitions, or it can have an array type where you can define these checked errors in-line in your workflow definition. 1. Referencing a reusable JSON/Yaml error definition file: 2. Defining workflow errors in-line: These defined errors can then be referenced by their unique name in both states `onErrors` definitions as well as in actions `nonRetryableErrors` and `retryableErrors` properties. Retries allow workflows to deal with intermittent failures of services they are trying to invoke. In addition, retries allow workflows to continue (not fail) execution and allow us to fix possible errors with invoked services and continue execution after they are fixed. Retries are important for both short-lived and long-lived workflows, as well as in both stateless and stateful scenarios. 1. Retrying on specified known (checked) errors. 2. Automatic retrying on both known (checked) and not-known (unchecked) errors. Which retry option the workflow should use by default is defined via the workflow top-level `autoRetries` property. By default, the value of the `autoRetries` is set to `false`, meaning that retry option 1) is used by default. You can enable automatic retrying (option 2) by setting `autoRetries` to `true`. Regardless of the chosen retries option, note that workflows in general should be designed to not fail. Workflows should be able to recover from intermittent failures. This is the default option when the workflow top-level `autoRetries` property is not specified or is set to `false`. This retry options is suited for stateless / short-running workflows where retries should be performed when specifically wanted. Note that in this scenario when unknown (unchecked) errors happen during action execution (service invocation), Workflow Execution should fail. Let's take a look at an example. To start, let's define a workflow top-level `retries` definition: Our `retries` definitions can be referenced by actions. For example: Each action can define the retry strategy it wants to use. If it does not define one, the action is in this case not retries. Actions can define a list of known errors in its `retryableErrors` array. If defined, then the action should be retried for those errors according to the referenced retry strategy. In our example, "MyFirstFunction" invocation should be retried according to the "FirstRetryStrategy" policy only on known errors "SomeErrorOne" and "SomeErrorTwo". If for a known error (defined in `retryableErrors`) the retry limit is reached and the error still persist, it can be handled in the states `onErrors` definition. If an unknown (unchecked) error happens during action execution, and this error is also not handled in the states `onErrors` definition, the This is the option used when the workflow top-level `autoRetries` property is set to `true`. Automatic retries are well suited to long-running and stateful workflow orchestrations. It allows workflows to recover from failures thus providing more resilience. There is a possible cost associated with automatic retries in terms of resource and computing power utilization. With this retries option, action executions should be retried automatically for both known (checked) as well as unknown (unchecked) errors. This means that you do not have to define a retry strategy for actions for them to have retried, it's included by default. Users can still define a custom retry strategy for each action via the `retryRef` property. If a retry strategy is not defined, a default retry strategy should be used. Runtime implementations can define their own default retry strategy. Serverless Workflow recommends the following settings: * `maxAttempts` to be `unlimited`, meaning that the action should be retried indefinitely until successful. * `delay` to be set to one second, meaning that there is a one second delay between action retries. * `multiplier` to be set to two meaning that the delay should be multiplied by two for each retry attempt. Runtimes should document their default retry strategy to users, so it's clear which property values they are using for the default. Actions can define for which known (checked) errors they should not be retried for. This is done via the actions `nonRetryableErrors` property. If a known error happens during action execution which is included in the `nonRetryableErrors` property array, that action should not be retried and the error then should be handled in the workflow states `onErrors` property. Let's take a look at an examples of defining retries when using the automatic retries option. This example assumes that the workfow top level `autoRetries` property is set to `true`. To start, let's define a workflow top-level `retries` definition: In our example the first action named `MyFirstFunction` is going to be retried according to the `FirstRetryStrategy` retry policy for all errors except `SomeErrorOne` and `SomeErrorTwo`. The seconds action named `MySecondFunction` is going to be retried according to the `SecondRetryStrategy` retry policy for all errors except `SomeErrorTwo` and `SomeErrorThree`. The third action named `MyThirdFunction` is going to retried according to the default runtime retry policy. It will be retried for all errors both known (checked) as well as unknown (unckecked). The fourth action named `MyFourthFunction` is going to be retried according to the `DoNotRetryStrategy` retry policy which has the `maxAttempts` property set to `1`, meaning that this action will not be retried. 1. Workflow execution 2. State execution 3. Action execution 4. Branch execution 5. Event consumption time The specification allows for timeouts to be defined on the top-level workflow definition, as well as in each of the workflow state definitions. Note that the timeout settings defined in states, and state branches overwrite the top-level workflow definition for state, action and branch execution. If they are not defined, then the top-level timeout settings should take in effect. This top-level workflow timeout setting defines that the maximum execution time of all defined workflow states is two seconds each. Now let's say that we have worfklow states "A" and "B". State "A" does not define a timeout definition, but state "B" does: Since state "A" does not overwrite the top-level `stateExecTimeout`, its execution timeout should be inherited from the top-level timeout definition. On the other hand, state "B" does define it's own `stateExecTimeout`, in which case it would overwrite the default setting, meaning that it would its execution time has a max limit of ten seconds. Defining timeouts is not mandatory, meaning that if not defined, all the timeout settings should be assumed to be "unlimited". Note that the defined Workflow Execution timeout has precedence over all other defined timeouts. Just to give an extreme example, let's say we define the Workflow Execution timeout to ten seconds, and the state execution timeout to twenty seconds. In this case if the Workflow Execution timeout is reached it should follow the rules of Workflow Execution timeout and end Workflow Execution, no matter what the state execution time has been set to. Workflow timeouts are defined with the top-level `timeouts` property. It can have two types, `string` and `object`. If `string` type it defines an URI that points to a Json or Yaml file containing the workflow timeout definitions. If `object` type, it is used to define the timeout definitions in-line and has the following properties: | [workflowExecTimeout](#workflowexectimeout-definition) | Workflow execution timeout (ISO 8601 duration format) | string or object | no | | [stateExecTimeout](#states-timeout-definition) | Workflow state execution timeout (ISO 8601 duration format) | string | no | | actionExecTimeout | Actions execution timeout (ISO 8601 duration format) | string | no | | [branchExecTimeout](#branch-timeout-definition) | Branch execution timeout (ISO 8601 duration format) | string | no | | [eventTimeout](#event-timeout-definition) | Default timeout for consuming defined events (ISO 8601 duration format) | string | no | The `eventTimeout` property defines the maximum amount of time to wait to consume defined events. If not specified it should default to "unlimited". The `branchExecTimeout` property defines the maximum execution time for a single branch. If not specified it should default to The `actionExecTimeout` property defines the maximum execution time for a single actions definition. If not specified it should default to "unlimited". Note that an action definition can include multiple actions. The `stateExecTimeout` property defines the maximum execution time for a single workflow state. If not specified it should default to The `workflowExecTimeout` property defines the Workflow Execution timeout. It is defined using the ISO 8601 duration format. If not defined, the Workflow Execution should be given "unlimited" amount of time to complete. `workflowExecTimeout` can have two possibly types, either `string` or `object`. If `string` type, it defines the maximum Workflow Execution time. If Object type it has the following format: | duration | Timeout duration (ISO 8601 duration format) | string | yes | | interrupt | If `false`, workflow instance is allowed to finish current execution. If `true`, current Workflow Execution is stopped immediately. Default is `false` | boolean | no | | runBefore | Name of a workflow state to be executed before workflow instance is terminated | string | no | The `duration` property defines the time duration of the execution timeout. Once a workflow instance is created, and the amount of the defined time is reached, the workflow instance should be terminated. The `interrupt` property defines if the currently running instance should be allowed to finish its current execution flow before it needs to be terminated. If set to `true`, the current instance execution should stop immediately. The `runBefore` property defines a name of a workflow state to be executed before workflow instance is terminated. States referenced by `runBefore` (as well as any other states that they transition to) must obey following rules: * They should not have any incoming transitions (should not be part of the main workflow control-flow logic) * They cannot be states marked for compensation (have their `usedForCompensation` property set to `true`) * If it is a single state, it must define an [end definition](#End-Definition), if it transitions to other states, at last one must define it. * They can transition only to states are also not part of the main control flow logic (and are not marked for compensation). Runtime implementations should raise compile time / parsing exceptions if any of the rules mentioned above are not obeyed in the workflow definition. All workflow states except Sleep and Inject States can define the `timeouts` property and can define different timeout settings depending on their state type. Please reference each [workflow state definitions](#Workflow-States) for more information on which timeout settings are available for each state type. Workflow states timeouts cannot define the `workflowExecTimeout` property. Workflow states can set their `stateExecTimeout` property inside the `timeouts` definition. The value of this property is a time duration (ISO 8601 duration format). It must be a duration that's greater than zero and defines the total state execution timeout. When this timeout is reached, state execution should be stopped and can be handled as a timeout error in the states `onErrors` definition. [Parallel states](#Parallel-State) can define the `branchExecTimeout` property. If defined on the state level, it applies to each [branch](#Parallel-State-Branch) of the Parallel state. Note that each parallel state branch can overwrite this setting to define its own branch execution timeout. If a branch does not define this timeout property, it should be inherited from it's state definition branch timeout setting. If its state does not define it either, it should be inherited from the top-level workflow branch timeout settings. The Event state `timeouts` property can be used to specify state specific timeout settings. For event state it can contain the `eventTimeout` property which is defined using the ISO 8601 data and time format. You can specify for example "PT15M" to represent 15 minutes or "P2DT3H4M" to represent 2 days, 3 hours and 4 minutes. `eventTimeout` values should always be represented as durations and not as specific time intervals. The `eventTimeout` property needs to be described in detail for Event states as it depends on whether or not the Event state is a workflow starting state or not. If the Event state is a workflow starting state, incoming events may trigger workflow instances. In this case, if the `exclusive` property is set to `true`, the `eventTimeout` property should be ignored. If the `exclusive` property is set to `false`, in this case, the defined `eventTimeout` represents the time between arrival of specified events. To give an example, consider the following: The first `eventTimeout` would start once any of the referenced events are consumed. If the second event does not occur within the defined eventTimeout, no workflow instance should be created. If the event state is not a workflow starting state, the `eventTimeout` property is relative to the time when the state becomes active. If the defined event conditions (regardless of the value of the exclusive property) are not satisfied within the defined timeout period, the event state should transition to the next state or end the workflow instance in case it is an end state without performing any actions. Compensation deals with undoing or reversing the work of one or more states which have already successfully completed. For example, let's say that we have charged a customer $100 for an item purchase. In the case customer laster on decides to cancel this purchase we need to undo it. One way of doing that is to credit the customer $100. It's important to understand that compensation with workflows is not the same as for example rolling back a transaction (a strict undo). Compensating a workflow state which has successfully completed might involve multiple logical steps and thus is part of the overall business logic that must be defined within the workflow itself. To explain this let's use our previous example and say that when our customer made the item purchase, our workflow has sent her/him a confirmation email. In the case, to compensate this purchase, we cannot just "undo" the confirmation email sent. Instead, we want to send a second email to the customer which includes purchase cancellation information. Compensation in Serverless Workflow must be explicitly defined by the workflow control flow logic. It cannot be dynamically triggered by initial workflow data, event payloads, results of service invocations, or errors. Each workflow state can define how it should be compensated via its `compensatedBy` property. This property references another workflow state (by its unique name) which is responsible for the actual compensation. States referenced by `compensatedBy` (as well as any other states that they transition to) must obey following rules: * They cannot be an [event state](#Event-State) * They cannot define an [end definition](#End-definition). If they do, it should be ignored * They must define the `usedForCompensation` property and set it to `true` * They can transition only to states which also have their `usedForCompensation` property set to `true` * They cannot themselves set their `compensatedBy` property to any state (compensation is not recursive) Let's take a look at an example workflow state which defines its `compensatedBy` property, and the compensation state it references: In this example our "NewItemPurchase" [event state](#Event-state) waits for a "NewPurchase" event and then debits the customer and sends them a purchase confirmation email. It defines that it's compensated by the "CancelPurchase" [operation state](#Operation-state) which performs two actions, namely credits back the purchase amount to customer and sends them a purchase cancellation email. As previously mentioned, compensation must be explicitly triggered by the workflows control-flow logic. This can be done via [transition](#Transition-definition) and [end](#End-definition) definitions. 1. Compensation triggered on transition: Transitions can trigger compensations by specifying the `compensate` property and setting it to `true`. This means that before the transition is executed (workflow continues its execution to the "NextWorkflowState" in this example), workflow compensation must be performed. 2. Compensation triggered by end definition: End definitions can trigger compensations by specifying the `compensate` property and setting it to `true`. This means that before workflow finishes its execution workflow compensation must be performed. Note that in case when the end definition has its `produceEvents` property set, compensation must be performed before producing the specified events and ending Workflow Execution. In the case the end definition has a `continueAs` property defined, compensation must be performed before Workflow Execution continues as a new workflow invocation. In the case where the end definition has both `produceEvents`, and `continueAs` compensation is performed first, then the event should be produced, and then the workflow should continue its execution as a new workflow invocation. Now that we have seen how to define and trigger compensation, we need to go into details on how compensation should be executed. Compensation is performed on all already successfully completed states (that define `compensatedBy`) in **reverse** order. Compensation is always done in sequential order, and should not be executed in parallel. <img src="media/spec/compensation-exec.png" height="400px" alt="Compensation Execution Example"/> In this example lets say our Workflow Execution is at the "End" state which defines the `compensate` property to `true` as shown in the previous section. States with a red border, namely "A", "B", "D" and "E" are states which have so far been executed successfully. State "C" has not been executed during Workflow Execution in our example. When Workflow Execution encounters our "End" state, compensation has to be performed. This is done in **reverse** order: 1. State "E" is not compensated as it does not define a `compensatedBy` state 2. State "D" is compensated by executing compensation "D1" 3. State "B" is compensated by executing "B1" and then "B1-2" 4. State C is not compensated as it was never active during Workflow Execution 5. State A is not comped as it does not define a `compensatedBy` state <img src="media/spec/compensation-exec2.png" height="200px" alt="Compensation Execution Example 2"/> In our example, when compensation triggers, the current workflow data is passed as input to the "D1" state, the first compensation state for our example. The states data output is then passed as states data input to "B1", and so on. In some cases when compensation is triggered, some states such as [Parallel](#Parallel-State) and [ForEach](#ForEach-State) states can still be "active", meaning they still might have some async executions that are being performed. If compensation needs to performed on such still active states, the state execution must be first cancelled. After it is cancelled, compensation should be performed. States that are marked as `usedForCompensation` can define [error handling](#Workflow-Error-Handling) via their `onErrors` property just like any other workflow states. In case of unrecoverable errors during their execution (errors not explicitly handled), Workflow Execution should be stopped, which is the same behavior as when not using compensation as well. In some cases our workflows are deployed and executed on runtimes and/or cloud platforms that expose some execution limitations such as finite execution duration, finite number of workflow transitions, etc. Some runtimes, especially when dealing with stateful workflow orchestrations have a finite limit of execution history log sizes, meaning that once a long-running workflow reaches these limits Workflow Executions is likely to be forced to stop before reaching its completion. This can result in unexpected issues, especially with mission-critical workflows. For those cases, the Serverless Workflow DSL provides a way to explicitly define stopping the current workflow instance execution, and starting a new one (for the same workflow id or a different one). This can be done via the [end definitions](#end-definition) `continueAs` property. The end definitions `continueAs` can be either of type `string` or `object`. If string type, it contains the unique workflow id of the workflow that the execution should continue as, for example: Defining this should stop the current Workflow Execution, and continue execution as a new workflow instance of the workflow which defines the workflow id of "myworkflowid". The state data where this is define should become the workflow data input of the workflow that is continuing the current Workflow Execution. Note that any defined `produceEvents` and `compensate` definitions should be honored before `continueAs` is applied. If `object` type, the `continueAs` property has the following properties: | workflowId | Unique id of the workflow to continue execution as. | string | yes | | version | Version of the workflow to continue execution as. | string | no | | data | If string type, a workflow expression which selects parts of the states data output to become the workflow data input of continued execution. If object type, a custom object to become the workflow data input of the continued execution. | string or object | no | | [`workflowExecTimeout`](#Workflow-Timeouts) | Workflow execution timeout to be used by the workflow continuing execution. Overwrites any specific settings set by that workflow. | string or object | no | Continuing execution with `continueAs` can also be used inside sub-Workflow Executions, which brings its next use case. Workflows can invoke sub-workflows during their execution. In Serverless Workflow DSL, sub-workflows are invoked similarly to other function types via the [SubFlowRef Definition](#SubFlowRef-Definition) in workflow states [Action](#Action-Definition) definitions. Just like "parent" workflows, sub-workflow can also be long-running, and can run into the same type of runtime/serverless platform limitations as previously discussed. As such they can also use `continueAs` to stop their current execution and continue it as a new one of the same or different workflow id. Note that when a sub-workflow is invoked it can produce a result that is then merged into the parent workflow state data. This may bring up a question as to what happens when a sub-workflow calls `continueAs` in terms of what is returned as result to of its invocation by the parent workflow. No matter how many times sub-workflow may use `continueAs`, to the parent workflow it should be as a single invocation is performed, meaning that the results of the last sub-workflow invocation (triggered by `continueAs`) should be used as the data returned by the invocation of the sub-workflow to the parent workflow. In any application, regardless of size or type, one thing is for sure: changes happen. Versioning your workflow definitions is an important task to consider. Versions indicate changes or updates of your workflow definitions to the associated execution runtimes. There are two places in the [workflow definition](#Workflow-Definition-Structure) where versioning can be applied: 1. Top level workflow definition `version` property. 2. Actions [subflowRef](#SubFlowRef-Definition) `version` property. The `version` property must respect the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) guidelines. Workflow constants are used to define static, and immutable, data which is available to [Workflow Expressions](#Workflow-Expressions). Constants can be defined via the [Workflow top-level "constants" property](#Workflow-Definition-Structure), for example: Constants can only be accessed inside Workflow expressions via the `$CONST` variable. Runtimes must make `$CONST` available to expressions as a predefined variable. Note that constants can also be used in [expression functions](#Using-Functions-for-Expression-Evaluation), Workflow constants values should only contain static data, meaning that their value should not contain Workflow expressions. Workflow constants data must be immutable. Workflow constants should not have access to [Workflow secrets definitions](#Workflow-Secrets). Secrets allow you access sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, ssh keys, etc inside your [Workflow Expressions](#Workflow-Expressions). You can define the names of secrets via the [Workflow top-level "secrets" property](#Workflow-Definition-Structure), If secrets are defined in a Workflow definition, runtimes must assure to provide their values during Workflow execution. Secrets can be used only in [Workflow expressions](#Workflow-Expressions) by referencing them via the `$SECRETS` variable. Runtimes must make `$SECRETS` available to expressions as a predefined variable. Note that secrets can also be used in [expression functions](#Using-Functions-for-Expression-Evaluation). Metadata enables you to enrich the serverless workflow model with information beyond its core definitions. It is intended to be used by clients, such as tools and libraries, as well as users that find this information relevant. Metadata should not affect Workflow Execution. Implementations may choose to use metadata information or ignore it. Note, however, that using metadata to control Workflow Execution can lead to vendor-locked implementations that do not comply with the main goals of this specification, which is to be completely vendor-neutral. - [Workflow Definition](#Workflow-Definition-Structure) - [Function definitions](#Function-Definition) - [Event definitions](#Event-Definition) - [State definitions](#Workflow-States) - [Switch state](#Switch-State) [data](#Switch-State-Data-Conditions) and [event](#Switch-State-Event-Conditions) conditions. - UI tooling information such as sizing or scaling factors. - Build, release, or image information such as timestamps, release ids, git branches, PR numbers, etc. - Logging, monitoring, analytics, or audit repository information. - Labels used for organizing/indexing purposes, such as "release" "stable", "track", "daily", etc. Similar to [Constants](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/blob/main/specification.md#workflow-constants) and [Secrets](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/blob/main/specification.md#workflow-secrets), workflows expressions can have access to the context information of a running instance via the keyword `WORKFLOW`.

This document represents the current state of the specification. It includes all features so far released as well as all features planned to be added in the next release. You can find all specification releases [here](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/releases). You can find the specification roadmap [here](roadmap/README.md). Workflows allow us to capture and organize business requirements in a unified manner. They can bridge the gap between how we express and model business logic. A key component of workflows is the domain-specific language (DSL) we use to model our business logic and solutions. Selecting the appropriate workflow language for our business and technology domains is a very important decision to be considered. Serverless Workflow focuses on defining a **vendor-neutral**, **platform-independent**, and **declarative** workflow language that targets the serverless computing technology domain. It can be used to significantly bridge the gap between your unique business domain and the target technology domain. The lack of a common way to define and model workflows means that we must constantly re-learn how to write them. This also limits the potential for common libraries, tooling and infrastructure to aid workflow modeling and execution across different platforms. Portability as well as productivity that can be achieved from workflow orchestration is hindered overall. Serverless Workflow addresses the need for a community-driven, vendor-neutral and a platform-independent workflow language specification that targets the serverless computing technology domain. Having and using a specification-based workflow language allows us to model our workflows once and deploy them onto many different container/cloud platforms, expecting the same execution results. <p align="center"> <img src="media/spec/spec-goals.png" height="400px" alt="Serverless Workflow Specification Goals"/> </p> For more information on the history, development and design rationale behind the specification, see the [Serverless Workflow Wiki](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/wiki). <p align="center"> <img src="media/spec/spec-parts.png" width="600" alt="Serverless Workflow Specification Focus On Standards"/> </p> Serverless Workflow language takes advantage of well-established and known standards such as [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/), [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specifications, [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). <p align="center"> <img src="media/spec/spec-overview.png" height="400px" alt="Serverless Workflow Specification Overview"/> </p> The specification has multiple components: * Definitions of the workflow language. This is defined via the [Workflow JSON Schema](schema/workflow.json). You can use both [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) and [YAML](https://yaml.org/) formats to model your workflows. * Software Development Kits (SDKs) for [Go](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-go), [Java](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-java), [.NET](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-net), [Typescript](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-typescript) and [Python](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-python), and we plan to add them for more languages in the future. * Set of [Workflow Extensions](extensions/README.md) which allow users to define additional, non-execution-related workflow information. This information can be used to improve workflow performance. Some example workflow extensions include Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), Rate Limiting, Simulation, Tracing, etc. * Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) to be used as a specification conformance tool for runtime implementations. Following sections provide detailed descriptions of all parts of the Serverless Workflow language. This section describes some of the core Serverless Workflow concepts: A workflow definition is a JSON or YAML file that conforms to the Serverless Workflow specification DSL. It consists of the core [Workflow Definition Structure](#Workflow-Definition-Structure) and the [Workflow Model](#Workflow-Model) It defines a blueprint used by runtimes for its execution. A business solution can be composed of any number of related workflow definitions. Their relationships are explicitly modeled with the Serverless Workflow language (for example by using [SubFlowRef Definition](#SubFlowRef-Definition) in actions). Runtimes can initialize workflow definitions for some particular set of data inputs or events. A workflow instance represents a single Workflow Execution corresponding to the instructions provided by a workflow definition. A workflow instance can be short or long-running. A single workflow instance should be isolated, meaning it should not share state and data with other workflow instances. Workflow instances should be able to communicate with each other via events. Depending on their workflow definition, workflow instances can be short-lived or can execute for days, weeks, or years. Each workflow instances should have its unique identifier, which should remain unchanged throughout its execution. Workflow instances can be started providing some data input. This is described in detail in the [workflow data input](#Workflow-Data-Input) section. Workflow instances can also wait for examples to start their execution, which is the case where a workflow definition contains a [EventState](#Event-State) starting workflow state. The workflow definition also explicitly defines when a workflow instance should be completed. By default, instances should be completed once there are no active workflow paths (all active paths reach a state containing the default [end definition](#End-Definition)), or if the defined [`workflowExecTimeout`](#Workflow-Timeouts) time is reached. Other ways, such as using the `terminate` property of the [end definition](#End-Definition) to terminate instance execution, or defining an [`workflowExecTimeout`](#Workflow-Timeouts) property are also possible. For long-running workflow-executions, you can utilize the `keepActive` workflow property which provides more control as to when exactly to terminate Workflow Execution. In cases where a Workflow Execution should be continued as a new one, the DSL also provides the `continueAs` property which is described in detail in the [Continuing a new Execution](#Continuing-as-a-new-Execution) section. The Serverless Workflow language is composed of: * [Function definitions](#Function-Definition) - Reusable functions that can declare services that need to be invoked, or expressions to be evaluated. * [Event definitions](#Event-Definition) - Reusable declarations of events that need to be `consumed` to start or continue workflow instances, trigger function/service execution, or be `produced` during Workflow Execution. * [Retry definitions](#Retry-Definition) - Reusable retry definitions. Can specify retry strategies for service invocations during Workflow Execution. * [Timeout definitions](#Workflow-Timeouts) - Reusable timeout definitions. Can specify default Workflow Execution timeout, as well as workflow state, action, and branch execution timeouts. * [Errors definition](#Defining-Errors) - Reusable error definitions. Provide domain-specific error definitions which can be referenced in workflow states error handling. * [State definitions](#Workflow-States) - Definition of states, the building blocks of workflow `control flow logic`. States can reference the reusable function, event and retry definitions. Serverless Workflow data is represented in [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) format. Data flow and execution logic go hand in hand, meaning as Workflow Execution follows the workflow definition logic, so does the workflow data: <p align="center"> <img src="media/spec/workflowdataflow.png" height="400" alt="Serverless Workflow Data Flow"/> </p> The initial [Workflow data input](#Workflow-data-input) is passed to the workflow starting state as its data input. When a state finishes its execution, [its data output is passed as data input to the next state](#Information-passing-Between-States) that should be executed. When Workflow Execution ends, the last executed workflow state's data output becomes the final [Workflow data output](#Workflow-data-output). States can filter their data inputs and outputs using [State Data filters](#State-data-filters). States can also consume events as well as invoke services. These event payloads and service invocation results can be filtered using [Event data filters](#Event-data-filters) and [Action data filters](#Action-data-filters). Data filters use [workflow expressions](#Workflow-Expressions) for selecting and manipulating state data input and output, action inputs and results, and event payloads. Multiple filters can be combined to gain high level of control of your workflow state data. You can find an example of that in [this](#Using-multiple-data-filters) section. Data from consumed events,and action execution results are added/merged to state data. Reference the [data merging section](#Data-Merging) to learn about the merging rules that should be applied. The initial data input into a workflow instance. Must be a valid [JSON object](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-4). If no input is provided, the default data input should be an empty JSON object: ```json { } ``` Workflow data input is passed to the workflow starting state as its data input. <p align="center"> <img src="media/spec/workflowdatainput.png" height="350px" alt="Workflow data input"/> </p> States in a workflow can receive data (data input) and produce a data result (data output). The state's data input is typically the previous state's data output. When a state completes its execution, its data output is passed to the state's data input it transitions to. There are two rules to consider here: - If the state is the workflow starting state, its data input is the [workflow data input](#Workflow-data-input). - When Workflow Execution ends, the data output of the last executed state becomes the [workflow data output](#Workflow-data-output). <p align="center"> <img src="media/spec/basic-state-data-passing.png" height="350px" alt="Basic state data passing"/> </p> Each Workflow Execution should produce a data output. The workflow data output is the data output of the last executed workflow state. | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | input | Workflow expression to filter the states data input | string | no | | output | Workflow expression that filters the states data output | string | no | <details><summary><strong>Click to view example definition</strong></summary> <p> <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> ```json { "stateDataFilter": { "input": "${ .orders }", "output": "${ .provisionedOrders }" } } ``` </td> <td valign="top"> ```yaml stateDataFilter: input: "${ .orders }" output: "${ .provisionedOrders }" ``` </td> </tr> </table> </details> State data filters can be used to filter the state's data input and output. The state data filters `input` property expression is applied when the workflow transitions to the current state and receives its data input. It can be used to select only data that is needed and disregard what is not needed. If `input` is not defined or does not select any parts of the state's data input, its data input is not filtered. The state data filter `output` property expression is applied right before the state transitions to the next state defined. It filters the state's data output to be passed as data input to the transitioning state. If the current state is the workflow end state, the filtered state's data output becomes the workflow data output. If `output` is not defined or does not select any parts of the state's data output, its data output is not filtered. Results of the `input` expression should become the state data input. Results of the `output` expression should become the state data output. For more information on this you can reference the [data merging](#Data-Merging) section. Let's take a look at some examples of state filters. For our examples let's say the data input to our state is as follows: ```json { "fruits": [ "apple", "orange", "pear" ], "vegetables": [ { "veggieName": "potato", "veggieLike": true }, { "veggieName": "broccoli", "veggieLike": false } ] } ``` For the first example, our state only cares about fruits data, and we want to disregard the vegetables. To do this we can define a state filter: ```json { "stateDataFilter": { "input": "${ {fruits: .fruits} }" } } ``` The state data output then would include only the fruits data: ```json { "fruits": [ "apple", "orange", "pear"] } ``` <p align="center"> <img src="media/spec/state-data-filter-example1.png" height="400px" alt="State Data Filter Example"/> </p> For our second example, let's say that we are interested in the only vegetable "veggie-like". Here we have two ways of filtering our data, depending on if actions within our state need access to all vegetables, or only the ones that are "veggie-like". The first way would be to use both "input", and "output": ```json { "stateDataFilter": { "input": "${ {vegetables: .vegetables} }", "output": "${ {vegetables: [.vegetables[] | select(.veggieLike == true)]} }" } } ``` The states data input filter selects all the vegetables from the main data input. Once all actions have performed, before the state transition or Workflow Execution completion (if this is an end state), the "output" of the state filter selects only the vegetables which are "veggie like". <p align="center"> <img src="media/spec/state-data-filter-example2.png" height="400px" alt="State Data Filter Example"/> </p> The second way would be to directly filter only the "veggie like" vegetables with just the data input path: ```json { "stateDataFilter": { "input": "${ {vegetables: [.vegetables[] | select(.veggieLike == true)]} }" } } ``` | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | fromStateData | Workflow expression that filters state data that can be used by the action | string | no | | useResults | If set to `false`, action data results are not added/merged to state data. In this case 'results' and 'toStateData' should be ignored. Default is `true`. | boolean | no | | results | Workflow expression that filters the actions data results | string | no | | toStateData | Workflow expression that selects a state data element to which the action results should be added/merged into. If not specified denotes the top-level state data element | string | no | <details><summary><strong>Click to view example definition</strong></summary> <p> <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> ```json { "actionDataFilter": { "fromStateData": "${ .language }", "results": "${ .results.greeting }", "toStateData": "${ .finalgreeting }" } } ``` </td> <td valign="top"> ```yaml actionDataFilter: fromStateData: "${ .language }" results: "${ .results.greeting }" toStateData: "${ .finalgreeting }" ``` </td> </tr> </table> </details> Action data filters can be used inside [Action definitions.](#Action-Definition) Each action can define this filter which can: * Filter the state data to select only the data that can be used within function definition arguments using its `fromStateData` property. * Filter the action results to select only the result data that should be added/merged back into the state data using its `results` property. * Select the part of state data which the action data results should be added/merged to using the `toStateData` property. To give an example, let's say we have an action which returns a list of breads and pasta types. For our workflow, we are only interested into breads and not the pasta. Action results: ```json { "breads": ["baguette", "brioche", "rye"], "pasta": [ "penne", "spaghetti", "ravioli"] } ``` We can use an action data filter to filter only the breads data: ```json { "actions":[ { "functionRef": "breadAndPastaTypesFunction", "actionDataFilter": { "results": "${ {breads: .breads} }" } } ] } ``` The `results` will filter the action results, which would then be: ```json { "breads": [ "baguette", "brioche", "rye" ] } ``` Now let's take a look at a similar example (same expected action results) and assume our current state data is: ```json { "itemsToBuyAtStore": [ ] } ``` and have the following action definition: ```json { "actions":[ { "functionRef": "breadAndPastaTypesFunction", "actionDataFilter": { "results": "${ [ .breads[0], .pasta[1] ] }", "toStateData": "${ .itemsToBuyAtStore }" } } ] } ``` In this case, our `results` select the first bread and the second element of the pasta array. The `toStateData` expression then selects the `itemsToBuyAtStore` array of the state data to add/merge these results into. With this, after our action executes the state data would be: ```json { "itemsToBuyAtStore": [ "baguette", "spaghetti" ] } ``` In the case action results should not be added/merged to state data, we can set the `useResults` property to `false`. In this case, the `results` and `toStateData` properties should be ignored, and nothing is added/merged to state data. If `useResults` is not specified (or it's value set to `true`), action results, if available, should be added/merged to state data. | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | useData | If set to `false`, event payload is not added/merged to state data. In this case 'data' and 'toStateData' should be ignored. Default is `true`. | boolean | no | | data | Workflow expression that filters the event data (payload) | string | no | | toStateData | Workflow expression that selects a state data element to which the action results should be added/merged into. If not specified denotes the top-level state data element | string | no | <details><summary><strong>Click to view example definition</strong></summary> <p> <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> ```json { "eventDataFilter": { "data": "${ .data.results }" } } ``` </td> <td valign="top"> ```yaml eventDataFilter: data: "${ .data.results }" ``` </td> </tr> </table> </details> Event data filters can be used to filter consumed event payloads. They can be used to: * Filter the event payload to select only the data that should be added/merged into the state data using its `data` property. * Select the part of state data into which the event payload should be added/merged into using the `toStateData` property. Allows event data to be filtered and added to or merged with the state data. All events have to be in the CloudEvents format and event data filters can filter both context attributes and the event payload (data) using the `data` property. Here is an example using an event filter: <p align="center"> <img src="media/spec/event-data-filter-example1.png" height="400px" alt="Event Data Filter Example"/> </p> Note that the data input to the Event data filters depends on the `dataOnly` property of the associated [Event definition](#Event-Definition). If this property is not defined (has default value of `true`), Event data filter expressions are evaluated against the event payload (the CloudEvents `data` attribute only). If it is set to `false`, the expressions should be evaluated against the entire CloudEvent (including its context attributes). In the case event data/payload should not be added/merged to state data, we can set the `useData` property to `false`. In this case, the `data` and `toStateData` properties should be ignored, and nothing is added/merged to state data. If `useData` is not specified (or it's value set to `true`), event payload, if available, should be added/merged to state data. As [Event states](#Event-State) can take advantage of all defined data filters. In the example below, we define a workflow with a single event state and show how data filters can be combined. ```json { "id": "GreetCustomersWorkflow", "name": "Greet Customers when they arrive", "version": "1.0.0", "specVersion": "0.8", "start": "WaitForCustomerToArrive", "states":[ { "name": "WaitForCustomerToArrive", "type": "event", "onEvents": [{ "eventRefs": ["CustomerArrivesEvent"], "eventDataFilter": { "data": "${ .customer }", "toStateData": "${ .customerInfo }" }, "actions":[ { "functionRef": { "refName": "greetingFunction", "arguments": { "greeting": "${ .hello.spanish } ", "customerName": "${ .customerInfo.name } " } }, "actionDataFilter": { "fromStateData": "${ { hello, customerInfo } }", "results": "${ .greetingMessageResult }", "toStateData": "${ .finalCustomerGreeting }" } } ] }], "stateDataFilter": { "input": "${ .greetings } ", "output": "${ { finalCustomerGreeting } }" }, "end": true } ], "events": [{ "name": "CustomerArrivesEvent", "type": "customer-arrival-type", "source": "customer-arrival-event-source" }], "functions": [{ "name": "greetingFunction", "operation": "http://my.api.org/myapi.json#greeting" }] } ``` The workflow data input when starting Workflow Execution is assumed to include greetings in different languages: ```json { "greetings": { "hello": { "english": "Hello", "spanish": "Hola", "german": "Hallo", "russian": "" }, "goodbye": { "english": "Goodbye", "spanish": "Adis", "german": "Auf Wiedersehen", "russian": "" } } } ``` The workflow data input then becomes the data input of the starting workflow state. We also assume for this example that the CloudEvent that our event state consumes include the data (payload): ```json { "customer": { "name": "John Michaels", "address": "111 Some Street, SomeCity, SomeCountry", "age": 40 } } ``` Here is a sample diagram showing our workflow, each numbered step on this diagram shows a certain defined point during Workflow Execution at which data filters are invoked and correspond to the numbered items below. <p align="center"> <img src="media/spec/using-multiple-filters-example.png" height="400px" alt="Using Multple Filters Example"/> </p> **(1) Workflow execution starts**: Workflow data is passed to our "WaitForCustomerToArrive" event state as data input. Workflow executes its starting state, namely the "WaitForCustomerToArrive" event state. The event state **stateDataFilter** is invoked to filter its data input. The filters "input" expression is evaluated and selects only the "greetings" data. The rest of the state data input should be disregarded. At this point our state data should be: ```json { "hello": { "english": "Hello", "spanish": "Hola", "german": "Hallo", "russian": "" }, "goodbye": { "english": "Goodbye", "spanish": "Adis", "german": "Auf Wiedersehen", "russian": "" } } ``` **(2) CloudEvent of type "customer-arrival-type" is consumed**: Once the event is consumed, the "eventDataFilter" is triggered. Its "data" expression selects the "customer" object from the events data. The "toStateData" expression says that we should add/merge this selected event data to the state data in its "customerInfo" property. If this property exists it should be merged, if it does not exist, one should be created. At this point our state data contains: ```json { "hello": { "english": "Hello", "spanish": "Hola", "german": "Hallo", "russian": "" }, "goodbye": { "english": "Goodbye", "spanish": "Adis", "german": "Auf Wiedersehen", "russian": "" }, "customerInfo": { "name": "John Michaels", "address": "111 Some Street, SomeCity, SomeCountry", "age": 40 } } ``` **(3) Event state performs its actions**: Before the first action is executed, its actionDataFilter is invoked. Its "fromStateData" expression filters the current state data to select from its data that should be available to action arguments. In this example it selects the "hello" and "customerInfo" properties from the current state data. At this point the action is executed. We assume that for this example "greetingFunction" returns: ```json { "execInfo": { "execTime": "10ms", "failures": false }, "greetingMessageResult": "Hola John Michaels!" } ``` After the action is executed, the actionDataFilter "results" expression is evaluated to filter the results returned from the action execution. In this case, we select only the "greetingMessageResult" element from the results. The action filters "toStateData" expression then defines that we want to add/merge this action result to state data under the "finalCustomerGreeting" element. At this point, our state data contains: ```json { "hello": { "english": "Hello", "spanish": "Hola", "german": "Hallo", "russian": "" }, "goodbye": { "english": "Goodbye", "spanish": "Adis", "german": "Auf Wiedersehen", "russian": "" }, "customerInfo": { "name": "John Michaels", "address": "111 Some Street, SomeCity, SomeCountry", "age": 40 }, "finalCustomerGreeting": "Hola John Michaels!" } ``` **(4) Event State Completes Execution**: When our event state finishes its execution, the states "stateDataFilter" "output" filter expression is executed to filter the state data to create the final state data output. Because our event state is also an end state, its data output becomes the final [workflow data output](#Workflow-data-output). Namely: ```json { "finalCustomerGreeting": "Hola John Michaels!" } ``` Consumed event data (payload) and action execution results should be merged into the state data. Event and action data filters can be used to give more details about this operation. By default, with no data filters specified, when an event is consumed, its entire data section (payload) should be merged to the state data. Merging should be applied to the entire state data JSON element. In case of event and action filters, their "toStateData" property can be defined to select a specific element of the state data with which merging should be done against. If this element does not exist, a new one should be created first. When merging, the state data element and the data (payload)/action result should have the same type, meaning that you should not merge arrays with objects or objects with arrays etc. When merging elements of type object should be done by inserting all the key-value pairs from both objects into a single combined object. If both objects contain a value for the same key, the object of the event data/action results should "win". To give an example, let's say we have the following state data: ```json { "customer": { "name": "John", "address": "1234 street", "zip": "12345" } } ``` and we have the following event payload that needs to be merged into the state data: ```json { "customer": { "name": "John", "zip": "54321" } } ``` After merging the state data should be: ```json { "customer": { "name": "John", "address": "1234 street", "zip": "54321" } } ``` Merging array types should be done by concatenating them into a larger array including unique elements of both arrays. To give an example, merging: ```json { "customers": [ { "name": "John", "address": "1234 street", "zip": "12345" }, { "name": "Jane", "address": "4321 street", "zip": "54321" } ] } ``` into state data: ```json { "customers": [ { "name": "Michael", "address": "6789 street", "zip": "6789" } ] } ``` should produce state data: ```json { "customers": [ { "name": "Michael", "address": "6789 street", "zip": "6789" }, { "name": "John", "address": "1234 street", "zip": "12345" }, { "name": "Jane", "address": "4321 street", "zip": "54321" } ] } ``` Merging number types should be done by overwriting the data from events data/action results into the merging element of the state data. For example merging action results: ```json { "age": 30 } ``` into state data: ```json { "age": 20 } ``` would produce state data: ```json { "age": 30 } ``` Merging string types should be done by overwriting the data from events data/action results into the merging element of the state data. Workflow [functions](#Function-Definition) are reusable definitions for service invocations and/or expression evaluation. They can be referenced by their domain-specific names inside workflow [states](#Workflow-States). Reference the following sections to learn more about workflow functions: * [Using functions for RESTful service invocations](#Using-Functions-for-RESTful-Service-Invocations) * [Using Functions for Async API Service Invocations](#Using-Functions-for-Async-API-Service-Invocations) * [Using functions for gRPC service invocation](#Using-Functions-For-RPC-Service-Invocations) * [Using functions for GraphQL service invocation](#Using-Functions-For-GraphQL-Service-Invocations) * [Using Functions for OData Service Invocations](#Using-Functions-for-OData-Service-Invocations) * [Using functions for expression evaluations](#Using-Functions-For-Expression-Evaluation) * [Defining custom function types](#defining-custom-function-types) We can define if functions are invoked sync or async. Reference the [functionRef](#FunctionRef-Definition) to learn more on how to do this. [Functions](#Function-Definition) can be used to describe services and their operations that need to be invoked during Workflow Execution. They can be referenced by states [action definitions](#Action-Definition) to clearly define when the service operations should be invoked during Workflow Execution, as well as the data parameters passed to them if needed. Note that with Serverless Workflow, we can also define invocation of services which are triggered via an event. To learn more about that, please reference the [event definitions](#Event-Definition) section, as well as the [actions definitions](#Action-Definition) [eventRef](#EventRef-Definition) property. Because of an overall lack of a common way to describe different services and their operations, many workflow languages typically chose to define custom function definitions. This approach, however, often runs into issues such as lack of portability, limited capabilities, as well as forcing non-workflow-specific information, such as service authentication, to be added inside the workflow language. To avoid these issues, the Serverless Workflow specification mandates that details about RESTful services and their operations be described using the [OpenAPI Specification](https://www.openapis.org/). OpenAPI is a language-agnostic standard that describes discovery of RESTful services. This allows Serverless Workflow language to describe RESTful services in a portable way, as well as workflow runtimes to utilize OpenAPI tooling and APIs to invoke service operations. Here is an example function definition for a RESTful service operation. ```json { "functions": [ { "name": "sendOrderConfirmation", "operation": "file://confirmationapi.json#sendOrderConfirmation" } ] } ``` It can, as previously mentioned be referenced during Workflow Execution when the invocation of this service is desired. For example: ```json { "states": [ { "name":"SendConfirmState", "type":"operation", "actions":[ { "functionRef": "sendOrderConfirmation" }], "end": true }] } ``` Note that the referenced function definition type in this case must be `rest` (default type). For more information about functions, reference the [Functions definitions](#Function-Definition) section. [Functions](#Function-Definition) can be used to invoke PUBLISH and SUBSCRIBE operations on a message broker documented by the [Async API Specification](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/v2.1.0). [Async API operations](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/v2.1.0#operationObject) are bound to a [channel](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/v2.1.0#definitionsChannel) which describes the technology, security mechanisms, input and validation to be used for their execution. Let's take a look at a hypothetical Async API document (assumed its stored locally with the file name `streetlightsapi.yaml`) and define a single publish operation: ```yaml asyncapi: 2.1.0 info: title: Streetlights API version: 1.0.0 description: | The Smartylighting Streetlights API allows you to remotely manage the city lights. license: name: Apache 2.0 url: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 servers: mosquitto: url: mqtt://test.mosquitto.org protocol: mqtt channels: light/measured: publish: summary: Inform about environmental lighting conditions for a particular streetlight. operationId: onLightMeasured message: name: LightMeasured payload: type: object properties: id: type: integer minimum: 0 description: Id of the streetlight. lumens: type: integer minimum: 0 description: Light intensity measured in lumens. sentAt: type: string format: date-time description: Date and time when the message was sent. ``` To define a workflow action invocation, we can then use the following workflow [Function Definition](#Function-Definition) and set the `operation` to `onLightMeasured`: ```json { "functions": [ { "name": "publishLightMeasurements", "operation": "file://streetlightsapi.yaml#onLightMeasured", "type": "asyncapi" }] } ``` Note that the [Function Definition](#Function-Definition)'s `operation` property must have the following format: ```text <URI_to_asyncapi_file>#<OperationId> ``` Also note that the referenced function definition type in this case must have the value `asyncapi`. Our defined function definition can then we referenced in a workflow [action](#Action-Definition), for example: ```json { "name": "Publish Measurements", "type": "operation", "actions":[ { "name": "Publish Light Measurements", "functionRef":{ "refName": "publishLightMeasurements", "arguments":{ "id": "${ .currentLight.id }", "lumens": "${ .currentLight.lumens }", "sentAt": "${ now }" } } } ] } ``` Similar to defining invocations of operations on RESTful services, you can also use the workflow [functions definitions](#Function-Definition) that follow the remote procedure call (RPC) protocol. For RPC invocations, the Serverless Workflow specification mandates that they are described using [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), a widely used RPC system. gRPC uses [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) to define messages, services, and the methods on those services that can be invoked. Let's look at an example of invoking a service method using RPC. For this example let's say we have the following gRPC protocol buffer definition in a myuserservice.proto file: ```text service UserService { rpc AddUser(User) returns (google.protobuf.Empty) { option (google.api.http) = { post: "/api/v1/users" body: "*" }; } rpc ListUsers(ListUsersRequest) returns (stream User) { option (google.api.http) = { get: "/api/v1/users" }; } rpc ListUsersByRole(UserRole) returns (stream User) { option (google.api.http) = { get: "/api/v1/users/role" }; } rpc UpdateUser(UpdateUserRequest) returns (User) { option (google.api.http) = { patch: "/api/v1/users/{user.id}" body: "*" }; } } ``` In our workflow definition, we can then use function definitions: ```json { "functions": [ { "name": "listUsers", "operation": "file://myuserservice.proto#UserService#ListUsers", "type": "rpc" } ] } ``` Note that the `operation` property has the following format: ```text <URI_to_proto_file>#<Service_Name>#<Service_Method_Name> ``` Note that the referenced function definition type in this case must be `rpc`. For more information about functions, reference the [Functions definitions](#Function-Definition) section. If you want to use GraphQL services, you can also invoke them using a similar syntax to the above methods. We'll use the following [GraphQL schema definition](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/) to show how that would work with both a query and a mutation: ```graphql type Query { pets: [Pet] pet(id: Int!): Pet } type Mutation { createPet(pet: PetInput!): Pet } type Treat { id: Int! } type Pet { id: Int! name: String! favoriteTreat: Treat } input PetInput { id: Int! name: String! favoriteTreatId: Int } ``` In our workflow definition, we can then use a function definition for the `pet` query field as such: ```json { "functions": [ { "name": "getOnePet", "operation": "https://example.com/pets/graphql#query#pet", "type": "graphql" } ] } ``` Note that the `operation` property has the following format for the `graphql` type: ```text <url_to_graphql_endpoint>#<literal "mutation" or "query">#<mutation_or_query_field> ``` In order to invoke this query, we would use the following `functionRef` parameters: ```json { "refName": "getOnePet", "arguments": { "id": 42 }, "selectionSet": "{ id, name, favoriteTreat { id } }" } ``` Which would return the following result: ```json { "pet": { "id": 42, "name": "Snuffles", "favoriteTreat": { "id": 9001 } } } ``` Likewise, we would use the following function definition: ```json { "functions": [ { "name": "createPet", "operation": "https://example.com/pets/graphql#mutation#createPet", "type": "graphql" } ] } ``` With the parameters for the `functionRef`: ```json { "refName": "createPet", "arguments": { "pet": { "id": 43, "name":"Sadaharu", "favoriteTreatId": 9001 } }, "selectionSet": "{ id, name, favoriteTreat { id } }" } ``` Which would execute the mutation, creating the object and returning the following data: ```json { "pet": { "id": 43, "name": "Sadaharu", "favoriteTreat": { "id": 9001 } } } ``` Note you can include [expressions](#Workflow-Expressions) in both `arguments` and `selectionSet`: ```json { "refName": "getOnePet", "arguments": { "id": "${ .petId }" }, "selectionSet": "{ id, name, age(useDogYears: ${ .isPetADog }) { dateOfBirth, years } }" } ``` Expressions must be evaluated before executing the operation. Note that GraphQL Subscriptions are not supported at this time. For more information about functions, reference the [Functions definitions](#Function-Definition) section. Similar to defining invocations of operations on GraphQL services, you can also use workflow [Functions Definitions](#Function-Definition) to execute complex queries on an [OData](https://www.odata.org/documentation/) service. We start off by creating a workflow [Functions Definitions](#Function-Definition). For example: ```json { "functions": [ { "name": "queryPersons", "operation": "https://services.odata.org/V3/OData/OData.svc#Persons", "type": "odata" } ] } ``` Note that the `operation` property must follow the following format: ```text <URI_to_odata_service>#<Entity_Set_Name> ``` In order to invoke the defined [OData](https://www.odata.org/documentation/) function, simply reference it in a workflow [Action Definition](#Action-Definition) and set its function arguments. For example: ```json { "refName": "queryPersons", "arguments": { "queryOptions":{ "expand": "PersonDetail/Person", "select": "Id, PersonDetail/Person/Name", "top": 5, "orderby": "PersonDetail/Person/Name" } } } ``` In order to ensure compatibility of OData support across runtimes, the`arguments` property of an [OData](https://www.odata.org/documentation/) function reference should follow the Serverless Workflow [OData Json schema](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/tree/main/schema/odata.json) In addition to defining RESTful, AsyncAPI, RPC, GraphQL and OData services and their operations, workflow [functions definitions](#Function-Definition) can also be used to define expressions that should be evaluated during Workflow Execution. Defining expressions as part of function definitions has the benefit of being able to reference them by their logical name through workflow states where expression evaluation is required. Expression functions must declare their `type` parameter to be `expression`. Let's take a look at an example of such definitions: ```json { "functions": [ { "name": "isAdult", "operation": ".applicant | .age >= 18", "type": "expression" }, { "name": "isMinor", "operation": ".applicant | .age < 18", "type": "expression" } ] } ``` Here we define two reusable expression functions. Expressions in Serverless Workflow can be evaluated against the workflow, or workflow state data. Note that different data filters play a big role as to which parts of the workflow data are being evaluated by the expressions. Reference the [State Data Filters](#State-data-filters) section for more information on this. Our expression function definitions can now be referenced by workflow states when they need to be evaluated. For example: ```json { "states":[ { "name":"CheckApplicant", "type":"switch", "dataConditions": [ { "name": "Applicant is adult", "condition": "${ fn:isAdult }", "transition": "ApproveApplication" }, { "name": "Applicant is minor", "condition": "${ fn:isMinor }", "transition": "RejectApplication" } ], "defaultCondition": { "transition": "RejectApplication" } } ] } ``` Our expression functions can also be referenced and executed as part of state [action](#Action-Definition) execution. Let's say we have the following workflow definition: ```json { "name": "simpleadd", "functions": [ { "name": "Increment Count Function", "type": "expression", "operation": ".count += 1 | .count" } ], "start": "Initialize Count", "states": [ { "name": "Initialize Count", "type": "inject", "data": { "count": 0 }, "transition": "Increment Count" }, { "name": "Increment Count", "type": "operation", "actions": [ { "functionRef": "Increment Count Function", "actionDataFilter": { "toStateData": "${ .count }" } } ], "end": true } ] } ``` The starting [inject state](#Inject-State) "Initialize Count" injects the count element into our state data, which then becomes the state data input of our "Increment Count" [operation state](#Operation-State). This state defines an invocation of the "Increment Count Function" expression function defined in our workflow definition. This triggers the evaluation of the defined expression. The input of this expression is by default the current state data. Just like with "rest", and "rpc" type functions, expression functions also produce a result. In this case the result of the expression is just the number 1. The actions filter then assigns this result to the state data element "count" and the state data becomes: ``` json { "count": 1 } ``` Note that the used function definition type in this case must be `expression`. For more information about functions, reference the [Functions definitions](#Function-Definition) section. For more information about workflow expressions, reference the [Workflow Expressions](#Workflow-Expressions) section. [Function definitions](#function-definition) `type` property defines a list of function types that are set by the specification. Some runtime implementations might support additional function types that extend the ones defined in the specification. In those cases you can define a custom function type with for example: ```json { "functions": [ { "name": "sendOrderConfirmation", "operation": "/path/to/my/script/order.ts#myFunction", "type": "custom" } ] } ``` In this example we define a custom function type that is meant to execute an external [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) script. When a custom function type is specified, the operation property value has a **custom format**, meaning that its format is controlled by the runtime which provides the custom function type. Later, the function should be able to be used in an action as any other function supported by the specification: ```json [{ "states": [{ "name": "handleOrder", "type": "operation", "actions": [ { "name": "sendOrderConfirmation", "functionRef": { "refName": "sendOrderConfirmation", "arguments": { "order": "${ .order }" } } } ], "transition": "emailCustomer" }] }] ``` Note that custom function types are not portable across runtimes. Workflow model parameters can use expressions to select/manipulate workflow and/or state data. Note that different data filters play a big role as to which parts of the states data are to be used when the expression is evaluated. Reference the [State Data Filtering](#State-data-filters) section for more information about state data filters. By default, all workflow expressions should be defined using the [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) [version 1.6](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases/tag/jq-1.6) syntax. You can find more information on jq in its [manual](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/). Serverless Workflow does not mandate the use of jq and it's possible to use an expression language of your choice with the restriction that a single one must be used for all expressions in a workflow definition. If a different expression language needs to be used, make sure to set the workflow `expressionLang` property to identify it to runtime implementations. Note that using a non-default expression language could lower the portability of your workflow definitions across multiple container/cloud platforms. All workflow expressions in this document, [specification examples](examples/README.md) as well as [comparisons examples](comparisons/README.md) are written using the default jq syntax. Workflow expressions have the following format: ```text ${ expression } ``` Where `expression` can be either an in-line expression, or a reference to a defined [expression function definition](#Using-Functions-For-Expression-Evaluation). To reference a defined [expression function definition](#Using-Functions-For-Expression-Evaluation) the expression must have the following format, for example: ```text ${ fn:myExprFuncName } ``` Where `fn` is the namespace of the defined expression functions and `myExprName` is the unique expression function name. To show some expression examples, let's say we have the following state data: ```json { "applicant": { "name": "John Doe", "age" : 26, "email": "johndoe@something.com", "address" : { "streetAddress": "Naist street", "city" : "Nara", "postalCode" : "630-0192" }, "phoneNumbers": [ { "type" : "iPhone", "number": "0123-4567-8888" }, { "type" : "home", "number": "0123-4567-8910" } ] } } ``` In our workflow model we can define our reusable expression function: ```json { "functions": [ { "name": "IsAdultApplicant", "operation": ".applicant | .age > 18", "type": "expression" } ] } ``` We will get back to this function definition in just a bit, but now let's take a look at using an inline expression that sets an input parameter inside an action for example: ```json { "actions": [ { "functionRef": { "refName": "confirmApplicant", "arguments": { "applicantName": "${ .applicant.name }" } } } ] } ``` In this case our input parameter `applicantName` would be set to "John Doe". Expressions can also be used to select and manipulate state data, this is in particularly useful for state data filters. For example let's use another inline expression: ```json { "stateDataFilter": { "output": "${ .applicant | {applicant: .name, contactInfo: { email: .email, phone: .phoneNumbers }} }" } } ``` This would set the data output of the particular state to: ```json { "applicant": "John Doe", "contactInfo": { "email": "johndoe@something.com", "phone": [ { "type": "iPhone", "number": "0123-4567-8888" }, { "type": "home", "number": "0123-4567-8910" } ] } } ``` [Switch state](#Switch-State) [conditions](#Switch-State-Data-Conditions) require for expressions to be resolved to a boolean value (`true`/`false`). We can now get back to our previously defined "IsAdultApplicant" expression function and reference it: ```json { "dataConditions": [ { "condition": "${ fn:IsAdultApplicant }", "transition": "StartApplication" }] } ``` As previously mentioned, expressions are evaluated against certain subsets of data. For example the `parameters` param of the [functionRef definition](#FunctionRef-Definition) can evaluate expressions only against the data that is available to the [action](#Action-Definition) it belongs to. One thing to note here are the top-level [workflow definition](#Workflow-Definition-Structure) parameters. Expressions defined in them can only be evaluated against the initial [workflow data input](#Workflow-Data-Input). For example let's say that we have a workflow data input of: ```json { "inputVersion" : "1.0.0" } ``` we can use this expression in the workflow "version" parameter: ```json { "id": "MySampleWorkflow", "name": "Sample Workflow", "version": "${ .inputVersion }", "specVersion": "0.8" } ``` which would set the workflow version to "1.0.0". Note that the workflow "id" property value is not allowed to use an expression. The workflow definition "id" must be a constant value. | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | id | Workflow unique identifier | string | yes (if `key` is not defined) | | key | Domain-specific workflow identifier | string | yes (if `id` is not defined) | | name | Workflow name | string | no | | description | Workflow description | string | no | | version | Workflow version.

Following figure describes the main workflow definition blocks. <p align="center"> <img src="media/spec/workflowdefinitionblocks.png" height="300px" alt="Serverless Workflow Definitions Blocks"/> </p> The `id` property defines the unique, domain-specific workflow identifier, for example "orders", "payment", etc. The `key` property defines the unique, domain-specific workflow identifier. It can be used when the `id` property is auto-generated by a content-management system for example. In these cases, you can specify the `key` property to be the domain-specific identifier of the workflow definition. The `id` and `key` properties are mutually exclusive, meaning you cannot define both. The `name` property is the workflow logical name. The `description` property can be used to give further information about the workflow. The `version` property can be used to provide a specific workflow version. It must use the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) format. The `annotations` property defines a list of helpful terms describing the workflows intended purpose, subject areas, or other important qualities, for example "machine learning", "monitoring", "networking", etc The `dataInputSchema` and `dataOutputSchema` properties can be used to validate input and output data against a defined JSON Schema. The `dataInputSchema` property validates the [workflow data input](#Workflow-Data-Input). Validation should be performed before any states are executed. In case of a start [Event state](#Event-state) the input schema is ignored, if present. The `failOnValidationErrors` property determines if Workflow Execution should continue in case of validation errors. The `dataOutputSchema` property validates the [Workflow data output](#workflow-data-output). Validation is performed on the output of the Workflow Execution. The `failOnValidationErrors` property determines what should be done when the workflow output does not match the provided schema. If `failOnValidationErrors` is true, an error should be thrown. If executed within a subprocess, that error can be be handled by the parent workflow. If `failOnValidationErrors` is false, the error should not be propagated. It is up to the implementor to warn the user about that fact. For example, printing a log. Both properties can be expressed as object or string type. If using object type, their `schema` property might be an URI, which points to the JSON schema used to validate the workflow data input, or it might be the JSON schema object. `failOnValidationErrors` is optional, default value is `true`. Example for Json schema reference ```json "dataInputSchema": { "schema": "URI to json schema", "failOnValidationErrors": false } ``` Example for Json schema included in the workflow file ```json "dataOutputSchema": { "schema": { "title": "MyJSONSchema", "properties":{ "firstName":{ "type": "string" }, "lastName":{ "type": "string" } } }, "failOnValidationErrors": true } ``` If using string type, then the string value is the external schema URI and `failOnValidationErrors` default value of `true` is assumed. Example using string type ```json "dataInputSchema": "URI_to_json_schema" ``` The `secrets` property allows you to use sensitive information such as passwords, OAuth tokens, ssh keys, etc. inside your Workflow expressions. It has two possible types, `string` or `array`. If `string` type, it is an URI pointing to a JSON or YAML document which contains an array of names of the secrets, for example: ```json "secrets": "file://workflowsecrets.json" ``` If `array` type, it defines an array (of string types) which contains the names of the secrets, for example: ```json "secrets": ["MY_PASSWORD", "MY_STORAGE_KEY", "MY_ACCOUNT"] ``` For more information about Workflow secrets, reference the [Workflow Secrets section](#Workflow-Secrets). The `constants` property can be used to define Workflow constants values which are accessible in [Workflow Expressions](#Workflow-Expressions). It has two possible types, `string` or `object`. If `string` type, it is an URI pointing to a JSON or YAML document which contains an object of global definitions, for example: ```json "constants": "file://workflowconstants.json" ``` If `object` type, it defines a JSON object which contains the constants definitions, for example: ```json { "AGE": { "MIN_ADULT": 18 } } ``` For more information see the [Workflow Constants](#Workflow-Constants) section. The `start` property defines the workflow starting information. For more information see the [start definition](#Start-Definition) section. This property is not required. If not defined, the workflow starting state has to be the very first state defined in the [workflow states array](#Workflow-States). The `specVersion` property is used to set the Serverless Workflow specification release version the workflow markup adheres to. It has to follow the specification release versions (excluding the leading "v"), meaning that for the [release version v0.8](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/releases/tag/v0.8) its value should be set to `"0.8"`. The `expressionLang` property can be used to identify the expression language used for all expressions in the workflow definition. The default value of this property is ["jq"](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/). You should set this property if you chose to define [workflow expressions](#Workflow-Expressions) with an expression language / syntax other than the default. The `timeouts` property is used to define the default workflow timeouts for workflow, state, action, and branch execution. For more information about timeouts and its use cases see the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section. The `error` property is used to define checked errors that can be explicitly handled during Workflow Execution. For more information about workflow error handling see [this section](#Defining-Errors). The `auth` property can be either an inline [auth](#Auth-Definition) definition array, or a URI reference to a resource containing an array of [auth](#Auth-Definition) definitions. If defined in a separate resource file (Json or Yaml), `auth` definitions can be re-used by multiple workflow definitions. Auth definitions can be used to define authentication that should be used to access the resource defined in the `operation` property of the [function](#Function-Definition) definitions. If we have the following function definition: ```json { "functions": [ { "name": "HelloWorldFunction", "operation": "https://secure.resources.com/myapi.json#helloWorld", "authRef": "My Basic Auth" } ] } ``` The `authRef` property is used to reference an authentication definition in the `auth` property and should be applied when invoking the `helloWorld` function. An [AuthRef](#AuthRef-Definition) object can alternatively be used to configure the authentication definition to use when accessing the function's resource and/or when invoking the function. The `functions` property can be either an in-line [function](#Function-Definition) definition array, or an URI reference to a resource containing an array of [functions](#Function-Definition) definition. Referenced resource can be used by multiple workflow definitions. Here is an example of using external resource for function definitions: 1. Workflow definition: ```json { "id": "sampleWorkflow", "version": "1.0.0", "specVersion": "0.8", "name": "Sample Workflow", "description": "Sample Workflow", "start": "MyStartingState", "functions": "http://myhost:8080/functiondefs.json", "states":[ ... ] } ``` 2. Function definitions resource: ```json { "functions": [ { "name":"HelloWorldFunction", "operation":"file://myapi.json#helloWorld" } ] } ``` Referenced resource must conform to the specifications [Workflow Functions JSON Schema](schema/functions.json). The `events` property can be either an in-line [event](#Event-Definition) definition array, or an [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) reference to a resource containing an array of [event](#Event-Definition) definition. Referenced resource can be used by multiple workflow definitions. Here is an example of using external resource for event definitions: 1. Workflow definition: ```json { "id": "sampleWorkflow", "version": "1.0.0", "specVersion": "0.8", "name": "Sample Workflow", "description": "Sample Workflow", "start": "MyStartingState", "events": "http://myhost:8080/eventsdefs.json", "states":[ ... ] } ``` 2. Event definitions resource: ```json { "events": [ { "name": "ApplicantInfo", "type": "org.application.info", "source": "applicationssource", "correlation": [ { "contextAttributeName": "applicantId" } ] } ] } ``` Referenced resource must conform to the specifications [Workflow Events JSON Schema](schema/events.json). The `retries` property can be either an in-line [retry](#Retry-Definition) definition array, or an URI reference to a resource containing an array of [retry](#Retry-Definition) definition. Referenced resource can be used by multiple workflow definitions. For more information about using and referencing retry definitions see the [Workflow Error Handling](#Workflow-Error-Handling) section. The `keepActive` property allows you to change the default behavior of workflow instances. By default, as described in the [Core Concepts](#Core-Concepts) section, a workflow instance is terminated once there are no more active execution paths, one of its active paths ends in a "terminate" [end definition](#End-Definition), or when its [`workflowExecTimeout`](#Workflow-Timeouts) time is reached. Setting the `keepActive` property to `true` allows you to change this default behavior in that a workflow instance created from this workflow definition can only be terminated if one of its active paths ends in a "terminate" [end definition](#End-Definition), or when its [`workflowExecTimeout`](#Workflow-Timeouts) time is reached. This allows you to explicitly model workflows where an instance should be kept alive, to collect (event) data for example. You can reference the [specification examples](#Examples) to see the `keepActive` property in action. The `extensions` property can be used to define extensions for this workflow definition. You can learn more about workflow extensions in the [Extensions](#extensions) section. Sample `extensions` property definition could look like this for example: ```json { "extensions": [ { "extensionId": "workflow-ratelimiting-extension", "path": "file://myextensions/ratelimiting.yml" }, { "extensionId": "workflow-kpi-extension", "path": "file://myextensions/kpi.yml" } ] } ``` Here we define two workflow extensions, namely the [rate limiting](extensions/ratelimiting.md) and [kpi](extensions/kpi.md) extensions for our workflow definition. Workflow states define building blocks of the Workflow Execution instructions. They define the control flow logic instructions on what the workflow is supposed to do. Serverless Workflow defines the following Workflow States: | Name | Description | Consumes events? | Produces events? | Executes actions? | Handles errors/retries? | Allows parallel execution? | Makes data-based transitions? | Can be workflow start state? | Can be workflow end state? | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **[Event](#Event-State)** | Define events that trigger action execution | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | no | yes | yes | | **[Operation](#Operation-State)** | Execute one or more actions | no | yes | yes | yes | yes | no | yes | yes | | **[Switch](#Switch-State)** | Define data-based or event-based workflow transitions | no | yes | no | yes | no | yes | yes | no | | **[Sleep](#Sleep-State)** | Sleep Workflow Execution for a specific time duration | no | yes | no | yes | no | no | yes | yes | | **[Parallel](#Parallel-State)** | Causes parallel execution of branches (set of states) | no | yes | no | yes | yes | no | yes | yes | | **[Inject](#Inject-State)** | Inject static data into state data | no | yes | no | yes | no | no | yes | yes | | **[ForEach](#ForEach-State)** | Parallel execution of states for each element of a data array | no | yes | no | yes | yes | no | yes | yes | | **[Callback](#Callback-State)** | Manual decision step. Executes a function and waits for callback event that indicates completion of the manual decision | yes | yes | yes | yes | no | no | yes | yes | | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | name | Unique State name | string | yes | | type | State type | string | yes | | exclusive | If `true`, consuming one of the defined events causes its associated actions to be performed.

If defined as the workflow starting state, the event state definition controls when the workflow instances should be created. The `exclusive` property determines if the state should wait for any of the defined events in the `onEvents` array, or if all defined events must be present for their associated actions to be performed. Following two figures illustrate the `exclusive` property: <p align="center"> <img src="media/spec/event-state-exclusive-true.png" height="300px" alt="Event state with exclusive set to true"/> </p> If the Event state in this case is a workflow starting state, the occurrence of *any* of the defined events would start a new workflow instance. <p align="center"> <img src="media/spec/event-state-exclusive-false.png" height="300px" alt="Event state with exclusive set to false"/> </p> If the Event state in this case is a workflow starting state, the occurrence of *all* defined events would start a new workflow instance. In order to consider only events that are related to each other, we need to set the `correlation` property in the workflow [events definitions](#Event-Definition). This allows us to set up event correlation rules against the events extension context attributes. If the Event state is not a workflow starting state, the `timeout` property can be used to define the time duration from the invocation of the event state. If the defined event, or events have not been received during this time, the state should transition to the next state or can end the Workflow Execution (if it is an end state). The `timeouts` property can be used to define state specific timeout settings. Event states can define the `stateExecTimeout`, `actionExecTimeout`, and `eventTimeout` properties. For more information about Event state specific event timeout settings reference [this section](#Event-Timeout-Definition). For more information about workflow timeouts reference the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section. Note that `transition` and `end` properties are mutually exclusive, meaning that you cannot define both of them at the same time. | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | name | Unique State name | string | yes | | type | State type | string | yes | | actionMode | Should actions be performed sequentially or in parallel.

Once all actions have been performed, a transition to another state can occur. The `timeouts` property can be used to define state specific timeout settings.

There are two types of conditions for switch states: * [Data-based conditions](#Switch-State-Data-Conditions) * [Event-based conditions](#Switch-State-Event-Conditions) These are exclusive, meaning that a switch state can define one or the other condition type, but not both. At times multiple defined conditions can be evaluated to `true` by runtime implementations. Conditions defined first take precedence over conditions defined later. This is backed by the fact that arrays/sequences are ordered in both JSON and YAML. For example, let's say there are two `true` conditions: A and B, defined in that order. Because A was defined first, its transition will be executed, not B's. In case of data-based conditions definition, switch state controls workflow transitions based on the states data. If no defined conditions can be matched, the state transitions is taken based on the `defaultCondition` property. This property can be either a `transition` to another workflow state, or an `end` definition meaning a workflow end. For event-based conditions, a switch state acts as a workflow wait state. It halts Workflow Execution until one of the referenced events arrive, then making a transition depending on that event definition. If events defined in event-based conditions do not arrive before the states `eventTimeout` property expires, state transitions are based on the defined `defaultCondition` property. The `timeouts` property can be used to define state specific timeout settings. Switch states can define the `stateExecTimeout` setting. If `eventConditions` is defined, the switch state can also define the `eventTimeout` property.

A parallel state can be seen a state which splits up the current workflow instance execution path into multiple ones, one for each branch. These execution paths are performed in parallel and are joined back into the current execution path depending on the defined `completionType` parameter value. The "completionType" enum specifies the different ways of completing branch execution: * allOf: All branches must complete execution before the state can transition/end. This is the default value in case this parameter is not defined in the parallel state definition. * atLeast: State can transition/end once at least the specified number of branches have completed execution. In this case you must also specify the `numCompleted` property to define this number. Exceptions may occur during execution of branches of the Parallel state, this is described in detail in [this section](#Parallel-State-Handling-Exceptions). The `timeouts` property can be used to set state specific timeout settings. Parallel states can define the `stateExecTimeout` and `branchExecTimeout` timeout settings. For more information on workflow timeouts reference the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section. Note that `transition` and `end` properties are mutually exclusive, meaning that you cannot define both of them at the same time. | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | name | Unique State name | string | yes | | type | State type | string | yes | | data | JSON object which can be set as state's data input and can be manipulated via filter | object | yes | | [stateDataFilter](#state-data-filters) | State data filter | object | no | | [transition](#Transitions) | Next transition of the workflow after injection has completed | string or object | yes (if `end` is not defined) | | [compensatedBy](#Workflow-Compensation) | Unique name of a workflow state which is responsible for compensation of this state | string | no | | [usedForCompensation](#Workflow-Compensation) | If `true`, this state is used to compensate another state.

Inject state does not perform any actions. It is very useful for debugging, for example, as you can test/simulate Workflow Execution with pre-set data that would typically be dynamic in nature (e.g., function calls, events). The inject state `data` property allows you to statically define a JSON object which gets added to the states data input. You can use the filter property to control the states data output to the transition state. Here is a typical example of how to use the inject state to add static data into its states data input, which then is passed as data output to the transition state: <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> ```json { "name":"SimpleInjectState", "type":"inject", "data": { "person": { "fname": "John", "lname": "Doe", "address": "1234 SomeStreet", "age": 40 } }, "transition": "GreetPersonState" } ``` </td> <td valign="top"> ```yaml name: SimpleInjectState type: inject data: person: fname: John lname: Doe address: 1234 SomeStreet age: 40 transition: GreetPersonState ``` </td> </tr> </table> The data output of the "SimpleInjectState" which then is passed as input to the transition state would be: ```json { "person": { "fname": "John", "lname": "Doe", "address": "1234 SomeStreet", "age": 40 } } ``` If the inject state already receives a data input from the previous transition state, the inject data should be merged with its data input. You can also use the filter property to filter the state data after data is injected. Let's say we have: <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> ```json { "name":"SimpleInjectState", "type":"inject", "data": { "people": [ { "fname": "John", "lname": "Doe", "address": "1234 SomeStreet", "age": 40 }, { "fname": "Marry", "lname": "Allice", "address": "1234 SomeStreet", "age": 25 }, { "fname": "Kelly", "lname": "Mill", "address": "1234 SomeStreet", "age": 30 } ] }, "stateDataFilter": { "output": "${ {people: [.people[] | select(.age < 40)]} }" }, "transition": "GreetPersonState" } ``` </td> <td valign="top"> ```yaml name: SimpleInjectState type: inject data: people: - fname: John lname: Doe address: 1234 SomeStreet age: 40 - fname: Marry lname: Allice address: 1234 SomeStreet age: 25 - fname: Kelly lname: Mill address: 1234 SomeStreet age: 30 stateDataFilter: output: "${ {people: [.people[] | select(.age < 40)]} }" transition: GreetPersonState ``` </td> </tr> </table> In which case the states data output would include only people whose age is less than 40: ```json { "people": [ { "fname": "Marry", "lname": "Allice", "address": "1234 SomeStreet", "age": 25 }, { "fname": "Kelly", "lname": "Mill", "address": "1234 SomeStreet", "age": 30 } ] } ``` You can change your output path easily during testing, for example change the expression to: ```text ${ {people: [.people[] | select(.age >= 40)]} } ``` This allows you to test if your workflow behaves properly for cases when there are people whose age is greater or equal 40. Note that `transition` and `end` properties are mutually exclusive, meaning that you cannot define both of them at the same time. | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | name | Unique State name | string | yes | | type | State type | string | yes | | inputCollection | Workflow expression selecting an array element of the states data | string | yes | | outputCollection | Workflow expression specifying an array element of the states data to add the results of each iteration | string | no | | iterationParam | Name of the iteration parameter that can be referenced in actions/workflow.

Each iteration of the ForEach state is by default executed in parallel by default. However, executing iterations sequentially is also possible by setting the value of the `mode` property to `sequential`. The `mode` property defines if iterations should be done sequentially or in parallel. By default, if `mode` is not specified, iterations should be done in parallel. If the default `parallel` iteration mode is used, the `batchSize` property to the number of iterations (batch) that can be executed at a time. To give an example, if the number of iterations is 55 and `batchSize` is set to `10`, 10 iterations are to be executed at a time, meaning that the state would execute 10 iterations in parallel, then execute the next batch of 10 iterations. After 5 such executions, the remaining 5 iterations are to be executed in the last batch. The batch size value must be greater than 1. If not specified, its value should be the size of the `inputCollection` (all iterations). The `inputCollection` property is a workflow expression which selects an array in the states data. All iterations are performed against data elements of this array. If this array does not exist, the runtime should throw an error. This error can be handled inside the states [`onErrors`](#Error-Definition) definition. The `outputCollection` property is a workflow expression which selects an array in the state data where the results of each iteration should be added to. If this array does not exist, it should be created. The `iterationParam` property defines the name of the iteration parameter passed to each iteration of the ForEach state. It should contain the unique element of the `inputCollection` array and made available to actions of the ForEach state. `iterationParam` can be accessed as an expression variable. [In JQ, expression variables are prefixed by $](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Variable/SymbolicBindingOperator:...as$identifier|...). If `iterationParam` is not explicitly defined, runtimes should create one and populate it with the value of the unique iteration parameter for each iteration of the ForEach state. The `actions` property defines actions to be executed in each state iteration. Let's take a look at an example: In this example the data input to our workflow is an array of orders: ```json { "orders": [ { "orderNumber": "1234", "completed": true, "email": "firstBuyer@buyer.com" }, { "orderNumber": "5678", "completed": true, "email": "secondBuyer@buyer.com" }, { "orderNumber": "9910", "completed": false, "email": "thirdBuyer@buyer.com" } ] } ``` and our workflow is defined as: <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> ```json { "id": "sendConfirmWorkflow", "name": "SendConfirmationForCompletedOrders", "version": "1.0.0", "specVersion": "0.8", "start": "SendConfirmState", "functions": [ { "name": "sendConfirmationFunction", "operation": "file://confirmationapi.json#sendOrderConfirmation" } ], "states": [ { "name":"SendConfirmState", "type":"foreach", "inputCollection": "${ [.orders[] | select(.completed == true)] }", "iterationParam": "completedorder", "outputCollection": "${ .confirmationresults }", "actions":[ { "functionRef": { "refName": "sendConfirmationFunction", "arguments": { "orderNumber": "${ $completedorder.orderNumber }", "email": "${ $completedorder.email }" } } }], "end": true }] } ``` </td> <td valign="top"> ```yaml id: sendConfirmWorkflow name: SendConfirmationForCompletedOrders version: '1.0.0' specVersion: '0.8' start: SendConfirmState functions: - name: sendConfirmationFunction operation: file://confirmationapi.json#sendOrderConfirmation states: - name: SendConfirmState type: foreach inputCollection: "${ [.orders[] | select(.completed == true)] }" iterationParam: completedorder outputCollection: "${ .confirmationresults }" actions: - functionRef: refName: sendConfirmationFunction arguments: orderNumber: "${ $completedorder.orderNumber }" email: "${ $completedorder.email }" end: true ``` </td> </tr> </table> The workflow data input containing order information is passed to the `SendConfirmState` [ForEach](#ForEach-State) state. The ForEach state defines an `inputCollection` property which selects all orders that have the `completed` property set to `true`. For each element of the array selected by `inputCollection` a JSON object defined by `iterationParam` should be created containing an unique element of `inputCollection` and passed as the data input to the parallel executed actions. So for this example, we would have two parallel executions of the `sendConfirmationFunction`, the first one having data: ```json { "completedorder": { "orderNumber": "1234", "completed": true, "email": "firstBuyer@buyer.com" } } ``` and the second: ```json { "completedorder": { "orderNumber": "5678", "completed": true, "email": "secondBuyer@buyer.com" } } ``` The results of each parallel action execution are stored as elements in the state data array defined by the `outputCollection` property. The `timeouts` property can be used to set state specific timeout settings. ForEach states can define the `stateExecTimeout` and `actionExecTimeout` settings. For more information on workflow timeouts reference the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section.

While some work performed in a serverless workflow can be executed automatically, some decisions must involve manual steps (e.g., human decisions). The Callback state allows you to explicitly model manual decision steps during Workflow Execution. The action property defines a function call that triggers an external activity/service. Once the action executes, the callback state will wait for a CloudEvent (defined via the `eventRef` property), which indicates the completion of the manual decision by the called service. Note that the called decision service is responsible for emitting the callback CloudEvent indicating the completion of the decision and including the decision results as part of the event payload. This event must be correlated to the workflow instance using the callback events context attribute defined in the `correlation` property of the referenced [Event Definition](#Event-Definition). Once the completion (callback) event is received, the Callback state completes its execution and transitions to the next defined workflow state or completes Workflow Execution in case it is an end state. The callback event payload is merged with the Callback state data and can be filtered via the "eventDataFilter" definition. If the defined callback event has not been received during this time period, the state should transition to the next state or end Workflow Execution if it is an end state. The `timeouts` property defines state specific timeout settings. Callback states can define the `stateExecTimeout`, `actionExecTimeout`, and `eventTimeout` properties. For more information on workflow timeouts reference the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section. Note that `transition` and `end` properties are mutually exclusive, meaning that you cannot define both of them at the same time. | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | name | Unique function name | string | yes | | operation | If type is `rest`, <path_to_openapi_definition>#<operation_id>.

The `type` property defines the function type. Its value can be either `rest` or `expression`. Default value is `rest`. Depending on the function `type`, the `operation` property can be: * If `type` is `rest`, a combination of the function/service OpenAPI definition document URI and the particular service operation that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'. For example `https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json#getPetById`. * If `type` is `asyncapi`, a combination of the AsyncApi definition document URI and the particular service operation that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'. For example `file://streetlightsapi.yaml#onLightMeasured`. * If `type` is `rpc`, a combination of the gRPC proto document URI and the particular service name and service method name that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'. For example `file://myuserservice.proto#UserService#ListUsers`. * If `type` is `graphql`, a combination of the GraphQL schema definition URI and the particular service name and service method name that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'. For example `file://myuserservice.proto#UserService#ListUsers`. * If `type` is `odata`, a combination of the GraphQL schema definition URI and the particular service name and service method name that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'. For example `https://services.odata.org/V3/OData/OData.svc#Products`. * If `type` is `expression`, defines the expression syntax. Take a look at the [workflow expressions section](#Workflow-Expressions) for more information on this. Defining custom function types is possible, for more information on that refer to the [Defining custom function types](#defining-custom-function-types) section. The `authRef` property references a name of a defined workflow [auth definition](#Auth-Definition). It is used to provide authentication info to access the resource defined in the `operation` property and/or to invoke the function. The [`metadata`](#Workflow-Metadata) property allows users to define custom information to function definitions. This allows you for example to define functions that describe of a command executions on a Docker image: ```yaml functions: - name: whalesayimage metadata: image: docker/whalesay command: cowsay ``` Note that using metadata for cases such as above heavily reduces the portability of your workflow markup. Function definitions themselves do not define data input parameters. Parameters can be defined via the `parameters` property in [function definitions](#FunctionRef-Definition) inside [actions](#Action-Definition). | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | resource | References an auth definition to be used to access the resource defined in the operation parameter | string | yes | | invocation | References an auth definition to be used to invoke the operation | string | no | The `authRef` property references a name of a defined workflow [auth definition](#Auth-Definition). It can be a string or an object. If it's a string, the referenced [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) is used solely for the function's invocation. If it's an object, it is possible to specify an [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) to use for the function's resource retrieval (as defined by the `operation` property) and another for its invocation. Example of a function definition configured to use an [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) called "My Basic Auth" upon invocation: ```yaml functions: - name: SecuredFunctionInvocation operation: https://test.com/swagger.json#HelloWorld authRef: My Basic Auth ``` Example of a function definition configured to use an [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) called "My Basic Auth" to retrieve the resource defined by the `operation` property, and an [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) called "My OIDC Auth" upon invocation: ```yaml functions: - name: SecuredFunctionInvocation operation: https://test.com/swagger.json#HelloWorld authRef: resource: My Basic Auth invocation: My OIDC Auth ``` Note that if multiple functions share the same `operation` path (*which is the first component of the operation value, located before the first '#' character*), and if one of them defines an [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) for resource access, then it should always be used to access said resource. In other words, when retrieving the resource of the function "MySecuredFunction2" defined in the following example, the "My Api Key Auth" [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) should be used, because the "MySecuredFunction1" has defined it for resource access. This is done to avoid unnecessary repetitions of [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) configuration when using the same resource for multiple defined functions. ```yaml functions: - name: MySecuredFunction1 operation: https://secure.resources.com/myapi.json#helloWorld authRef: resource: My ApiKey Auth - name: MySecuredFunction2 operation: https://secure.resources.com/myapi.json#holaMundo ``` It's worth noting that if an [auth definition](#Auth-Definition) has been defined for an OpenAPI function which's resource declare an authentication mechanism, the later should be used instead, thus ignoring entirely the [auth definition](#Auth-Definition). | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | name | Unique event name | string | yes | | source | CloudEvent source.

These events can be either consumed or produced during Workflow Execution as well as can be used to [trigger function/service invocations](#EventRef-Definition). The Serverless Workflow specification mandates that all events conform to the [CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec) specification. This is to assure consistency and portability of the events format used. The `name` property defines a single name of the event that is unique inside the workflow definition. This event name can be then referenced within [function](#Function-Definition) and [state](#Workflow-States) definitions. The `source` property matches this event definition with the [source](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md#source-1) property of the CloudEvent required attributes. The `type` property matches this event definition with the [type](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md#type) property of the CloudEvent required attributes. The `kind` property defines this event as either `consumed` or `produced`. In terms of the workflow, this means it is either an event that triggers workflow instance creation, or continuation of workflow instance execution (consumed), or an event that the workflow instance creates during its execution (produced). The default value (if not specified) of the `kind` property is `consumed`. Note that for `produced` event definitions, implementations must provide the value of the CloudEvent source attribute. In this case (i.e., when the `kind` property is set to `produced`), the `source` property of the event is not required in the workflow definition. Otherwise, (i.e., when the `kind` property is set to `consumed`), the `source` property must be defined in the event definition. Event correlation plays a big role in large event-driven applications. Correlating one or more events with a particular workflow instance can be done by defining the event correlation rules within the `correlation` property. This property is an array of [correlation](#Correlation-Definition) definitions. The CloudEvents specification allows users to add [Extension Context Attributes](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md#extension-context-attributes) and the correlation definitions can use these attributes to define clear matching event correlation rules. Extension context attributes are not part of the event payload, so they are serialized the same way as other standard required attributes. This means that the event payload does not have to be inspected by implementations in order to read and evaluate the defined correlation rules. Let's take a look at an example. Here we have two events that have an extension context attribute called "patientId" (as well as "department", which will be used in further examples below): ```json { "specversion" : "1.0", "type" : "com.hospital.patient.heartRateMonitor", "source" : "hospitalMonitorSystem", "subject" : "HeartRateReading", "id" : "A234-1234-1234", "time" : "2020-01-05T17:31:00Z", "patientId" : "PID-12345", "department": "UrgentCare", "data" : { "value": "80bpm" } } ``` and ```json { "specversion" : "1.0", "type" : "com.hospital.patient.bloodPressureMonitor", "source" : "hospitalMonitorSystem", "subject" : "BloodPressureReading", "id" : "B234-1234-1234", "time" : "2020-02-05T17:31:00Z", "patientId" : "PID-12345", "department": "UrgentCare", "data" : { "value": "110/70" } } ``` We can then define a correlation rule, through which all consumed events with the "hospitalMonitorSystem", and the "com.hospital.patient.heartRateMonitor" type that have the **same** value of the `patientId` property to be correlated to the created workflow instance: ```json { "events": [ { "name": "HeartRateReadingEvent", "source": "hospitalMonitorSystem", "type": "com.hospital.patient.heartRateMonitor", "kind": "consumed", "correlation": [ { "contextAttributeName": "patientId" } ] } ] } ``` If a workflow instance is created (e.g., via Event state) by consuming a "HeartRateReadingEvent" event, all other consumed events from the defined source and with the defined type that have the same "patientId" as the event that triggered the workflow instance should then also be associated with the same instance. You can also correlate multiple events together. In the following example, we assume that the workflow consumes two different event types, and we want to make sure that both are correlated, as in the above example, with the same "patientId": ```json { "events": [ { "name": "HeartRateReadingEvent", "source": "hospitalMonitorSystem", "type": "com.hospital.patient.heartRateMonitor", "kind": "consumed", "correlation": [ { "contextAttributeName": "patientId" } ] }, { "name": "BloodPressureReadingEvent", "source": "hospitalMonitorSystem", "type": "com.hospital.patient.bloodPressureMonitor", "kind": "consumed", "correlation": [ { "contextAttributeName": "patientId" } ] } ] } ``` Event correlation can be based on equality (values of the defined "contextAttributeName" must be equal), but it can also be based on comparing it to custom defined values (string, or expression). For example: ```json { "events": [ { "name": "HeartRateReadingEvent", "source": "hospitalMonitorSystem", "type": "com.hospital.patient.heartRateMonitor", "kind": "consumed", "correlation": [ { "contextAttributeName": "patientId" }, { "contextAttributeName": "department", "contextAttributeValue" : "UrgentCare" } ] } ] } ``` In this example, we have two correlation rules defined: The first one is on the "patientId" CloudEvent context attribute, meaning again that all consumed events from this source and type must have the same "patientId" to be considered. The second rule says that these events must all have a context attribute named "department" with the value of "UrgentCare". This allows developers to write orchestration workflows that are specifically targeted to patients that are in the hospital urgent care unit, for example. The `dataOnly` property deals with what Event data is accessible by the consuming Workflow states. If its value is `true` (default value), only the Event payload is accessible to consuming Workflow states. If `false`, both Event payload and context attributes should be accessible. Auth definitions can be used to define authentication information that should be applied to [function definitions](#Function-Definition). It can be used for both the retrieval of the function's resource (as defined by the `operation` property) and for the function's invocation. | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | name | Unique auth definition name | string | yes | | scheme | Auth scheme, can be "basic", "bearer", or "oauth2".

The Basic properties definition can have two types, either `string` or `object`. If `string` type, it defines a [workflow expression](#workflow-expressions) that contains all needed Basic auth information. If `object` type, it has the following properties: | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | username | String or a workflow expression.

Only usable for `consumed` event definitions. The `contextAttributeName` property defines the name of the CloudEvent [extension context attribute](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md#extension-context-attributes).

Note that the values of `eventRefs` array must be unique. The `actionMode` property defines if the defined actions need to be performed sequentially or in parallel. The `actions` property defines a list of actions to be performed. When specifying the `onEvents` definition it is important to consider the Event states `exclusive` property, because it determines how 'onEvents' is interpreted. Let's look at the following JSON definition of 'onEvents' to show this: ```json { "onEvents": [{ "eventRefs": ["HighBodyTemperature", "HighBloodPressure"], "actions": [{ "functionRef": { "refName": "SendTylenolOrder", "arguments": { "patient": "${ .patientId }" } } }, { "functionRef": { "refName": "CallNurse", "arguments": { "patient": "${ .patientId }" } } } ] }] } ``` Depending on the value of the Event states `exclusive` property, this definition can mean two different things: 1. If `exclusive` is set to `true`, the consumption of **either** the `HighBodyTemperature` or `HighBloodPressure` events will trigger action execution. 2. If `exclusive` is set to `false`, the consumption of **both** the `HighBodyTemperature` and `HighBloodPressure` events will trigger action execution. This is visualized in the diagram below: <p align="center"> <img src="media/spec/event-state-onevents-example.png" height="300px" alt="Event onEvents example"/> </p> | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | name | Unique Action name | string | no | | [functionRef](#FunctionRef-Definition) | References a reusable function definition | object or string | yes (if `eventRef` & `subFlowRef` are not defined) | | [eventRef](#EventRef-Definition) | References a `produce` and `consume` reusable event definitions | object | yes (if `functionRef` & `subFlowRef` are not defined) | | [subFlowRef](#SubFlowRef-Definition) | References a workflow to be invoked | object or string | yes (if `eventRef` & `functionRef` are not defined) | | [retryRef](#retry-definition) | References a defined workflow retry definition.

Service invocation can be done in three different ways: * Reference [functions definitions](#Function-Definition) by its unique name using the `functionRef` property. * Reference a `produced` and `consumed` [event definitions](#Event-Definition) via the `eventRef` property. * Reference a sub-workflow invocation via the `subFlowRef` property. Note that `functionRef`, `eventRef`, and `subFlowRef` are mutually exclusive, meaning that only one of them can be specified in a single action definition. The `name` property specifies the action name. In the event-based scenario a service, or a set of services we want to invoke are not exposed via a specific resource URI for example, but can only be invoked via an event. The [eventRef](#EventRef-Definition) property defines the referenced `produced` event via its `produceEventRef` property and a `consumed` event via its `consumeEventRef` property. The `sleep` property can be used to define time periods that Workflow Execution should sleep before and/or after function execution. It can have two properties: * `before` - defines the amount of time (ISO 8601 duration format) to sleep before function invocation. * `after` - defines the amount of time (ISO 8601 duration format) to sleep after function invocation. Function invocation timeouts should be handled via the states [timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) definition. The `retryRef` property references one of the defined workflow retries by it's unique name. If not set, the action should be retried according to the default retry policy of the runtime implementation. For more information about workflow retries reference [this section](#retry-definition). The `nonRetryableErrors` property is a list that references one or more unique names of workflow error definitions. This is the list of known errors for which the action should not be retried for. It should be used only when the workflow top-level `autoRetries` property is set to `true`. The `retryableErrors` property is a list that references one or more unique names of workflow error definitions. This is the list of known errors for which the action should be retried for. It should be used only when the workflow top-level `autoRetries` property is set to `false`. The `condition` property is a [workflow expression](#Workflow-Expressions). If defined, it must evaluate to `true` for this action to be performed. If it evaluates to `false` the action is skipped. If the `condition` property is not defined, the action is always performed. Often you want to group your workflows into small logical units that solve a particular business problem and can be reused in multiple other workflow definitions. <p align="center"> <img src="media/spec/subflowstateref.png" height="350px" alt="Referencing reusable workflow via SubFlow actions"/> </p> Reusable workflows are referenced by their `id` property via the SubFlow action `workflowId` parameter. For the simple case, `subFlowRef` can be a string containing the `id` of the sub-workflow to invoke. If you want to specify other parameters then a [subFlowRef](#SubFlowRef-Definition) should be provided instead. Each referenced workflow receives the SubFlow actions data as workflow data input. Referenced sub-workflows must declare their own [function](#Function-Definition) and [event](#Event-Definition) definitions. `FunctionRef` definition can have two types, either `string` or `object`. If `string` type, it defines the name of the referenced [function](#Function-Definition). This can be used as a short-cut definition when you don't need to define any other parameters, for example: ```json "functionRef": "myFunction" ``` Note that if used with `string` type, the invocation of the function is synchronous. If you need to define parameters in your `functionRef` definition, you can define it with its `object` type which has the following properties: | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | refName | Name of the referenced [function](#Function-Definition) | string | yes | | arguments | Arguments (inputs) to be passed to the referenced function | object | yes (if function type is `graphql`, otherwise no) | | selectionSet | Used if function type is `graphql`. String containing a valid GraphQL [selection set](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Selection-Sets) | string | yes (if function type is `graphql`, otherwise no) | | invoke | Specifies if the function should be invoked `sync` or `async`.

The `arguments` property defines the arguments that are to be passed to the referenced function. Here is an example of using the `arguments` property: ```json { "refName": "checkFundsAvailabe", "arguments": { "account": { "id": "${ .accountId }" }, "forAmount": "${ .payment.amount }", "insufficientMessage": "The requested amount is not available." } } ``` The `invoke` property defines how the function is invoked (sync or async). Default value of this property is `sync`, meaning that Workflow Execution should wait until the function completes. If set to `async`, Workflow Execution should just invoke the function and should not wait until its completion. Note that in this case the action does not produce any results and the associated actions actionDataFilter as well as its retry definition, if defined, should be ignored. In addition, functions that are invoked async do not propagate their errors to the associated action definition and the workflow state, meaning that any errors that happen during their execution cannot be handled in the workflow states onErrors definition. Note that errors raised during functions that are invoked async should not fail Workflow Execution.

The `data` property can have two types: string or object. If it is of string type, it is an expression that can select parts of state data to be used as payload of the event referenced by `produceEventRef`. If it is of object type, you can define a custom object to be the event payload. The `contextAttributes` property allows you to add one or more [extension context attributes](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md#extension-context-attributes) to the trigger/produced event. The `consumeEventTimeout` property defines the maximum amount of time (ISO 8601 format) to wait for the result event. If not defined it should default to the [actionExecutionTimeout](#Workflow-Timeout-Definition). If the event defined by the `consumeEventRef` property is not received in that set time, action invocation should raise an error that can be handled in the states `onErrors` definition. In case the `consumeEventRef` is not defined, the `consumeEventTimeout` property is ignored. The `invoke` property defines how the function is invoked (sync or async). Default value of this property is `sync`, meaning that Workflow Execution should wait until the function completes (the result event is received). If set to `async`, Workflow Execution should just produce the trigger event and should not wait for the result event. Note that in this case the action does not produce any results (payload of the result event) and the associated actions eventDataFilter as well as its retry definition, if defined, should be ignored. Functions that are invoked via events (sync or async) do not propagate their errors to the associated action definition and the workflow state, meaning that any errors that happen during their execution cannot be handled in the workflow states onErrors definition. Note that errors raised during functions that are invoked sync or async in this case should not fail Workflow Execution. `SubFlowRef` definition can have two types, namely `string` or `object`. If `string` type, it defines the unique id of the sub-workflow to be invoked. This short-hand definition can be used if sub-workflow lookup is done only by its `id` property and not its `version` property. ```json "subFlowRef": "mySubFlowId" ``` If you need to define the `version` properties, you can use its `object` type: | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | workflowId | Sub-workflow unique id | string | yes | | version | Sub-workflow version | string | no | | invoke | Specifies if the subflow should be invoked `sync` or `async`.

Usually, the workflow id should not be the same id of the workflow where the action is defined. Otherwise, it may occur undesired recurring calls to the same workflow. The `version` property defined the unique version of the sub-workflow to be invoked. If this property is defined, runtimes should match both the `id` and the `version` properties defined in the sub-workflow definition. The `invoke` property defines how the subflow is invoked (sync or async). Default value of this property is `sync`, meaning that Workflow Execution should wait until the subflow completes. If set to `async`, Workflow Execution should just invoke the subflow and not wait for its results. Note that in this case the action does not produce any results, and the associated actions actionDataFilter as well as its retry definition, if defined, should be ignored. Subflows that are invoked async do not propagate their errors to the associated action definition and the workflow state, meaning that any errors that happen during their execution cannot be handled in the workflow states onErrors definition. Note that errors raised during subflows that are invoked async should not fail Workflow Execution. The `onParentComplete` property defines how subflow execution that is invoked async should behave if the parent workflow completes execution before the subflow completes its own execution. The default value of this property is `terminate`, meaning that if the parent workflow (the workflow that invoked the subflow) completes, execution of the subflow should be terminated. If it is set to `continue`, if the parent workflow completes, the subflow execution is allowed to continue its own execution. | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | errorRef or errorRefs | Reference one unique workflow error definition, or multiple unique workflow error definitions | string (errorRef) or array (errorRefs) | yes | | [transition](#Transitions) | Transition to next state to handle the error | string or object | yes (if `end` is not defined) | | [end](#End-Definition) | End Workflow Execution if this error is encountered | boolean or object | yes (if `transition` is not defined) | <details><summary><strong>Click to view example definition</strong></summary> <p> <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> ```json { "errorRef": "Item not in inventory", "transition": "IssueRefundToCustomer" } ``` </td> <td valign="top"> ```yaml errorRef: Item not in inventory transition: IssueRefundToCustomer ``` </td> </tr> </table> </details> Error definitions describe checked errors that can occur during Workflow Execution and how to handle them. The `errorRef` property references the unique workflow error definition. For more info on workflow error handling referece [this section](#Defining-Errors). The `errorRefs`property references at least one of the defined workflow error definitions. Can be used when `errorRef` is not used. Usable when you want to define multiple error refs for which the same transition or end definition should be applied.For more info on workflow error handling referece [this section](#Defining-Errors). Note that the `errorRef` and `errorRefs` properties are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can only specify one or the other, but not both at the same time. The `transition` property defines the transition to the next workflow state in cases when the defined error happens during runtime execution. If `transition` is not defined you can also define the `end` property which will end Workflow Execution at that point. Note that the `transition` and `end` properties are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can only specify one or the other, but not both at the same time.

This is an explicit definition and can be reused across multiple defined state [actions](#Action-Definition). The `name` property specifies the unique name of the retry definition (strategy). This unique name can be referred by workflow states [error definitions](#Error-Definition). The `delay` property specifies the initial time delay between retry attempts (ISO 8601 duration format). The `increment` property specifies a static duration which will be added to the delay between successive retries. To explain this better, let's say we have the following retry definition: ```json { "name": "Timeout Errors Strategy", "delay": "PT10S", "increment": "PT2S", "maxAttempts": 4 } ``` which means that we will retry up to 4 times after waiting with increasing delay between attempts; in this example 10, 12, 14, and 16 seconds between retries. The `multiplier` property specifies the value by which the interval time is increased for each of the retry attempts. To explain this better, let's say we have the following retry definition: ```json { "name": "Timeout Errors Strategy", "delay": "PT10S", "multiplier": 2, "maxAttempts": 4 } ``` which means that we will retry up to 4 times after waiting with increasing delay between attempts; in this example 10, 20, 40, and 80 seconds between retries. If both `increment` and `multiplier` properties are defined, `increment` should be applied first and then the `multiplier` when determining the next retry time. The `maxAttempts` property determines the maximum number of retry attempts allowed and is a positive integer value. The `jitter` property is important to prevent certain scenarios where clients are retrying in sync, possibly causing or contributing to a transient failure precisely because they're retrying at the same time. Adding a typically small, bounded random amount of time to the period between retries serves the purpose of attempting to prevent these retries from happening simultaneously, possibly reducing total time to complete requests and overall congestion. How this value is used in the exponential backoff algorithm is left up to implementations. `jitter` may be specified as a percentage relative to the total delay. Once the next retry attempt delay is calculated, we can apply `jitter` as a percentage value relative to this calculated delay. For example, if your calculated delay for the next retry is six seconds, and we specify a `jitter` value of 0.3, a random amount of time between 0 and 1.8 (0.3 times 6) is to be added or subtracted from the calculated delay. Alternatively, `jitter` may be defined as an absolute value specified as an ISO 8601 duration. This way, the maximum amount of random time added is fixed and will not increase as new attempts are made. The `maxDelay` property determines the maximum amount of delay that is desired between retry attempts, and is applied after `increment`, `multiplier`, and `jitter`. To explain this better, let's say we have the following retry definition: ```json { "name": "Timeout Errors Strategy", "delay": "PT10S", "maxDelay": "PT100S", "multiplier": 4, "jitter": "PT1S", "maxAttempts": 4 } ``` which means that we will retry up to 4 times after waiting with increasing delay between attempts; in this example we might observe the following series of delays: * 11s (min(`maxDelay`, (`delay` +/- rand(`jitter`)) => min(100, 10 + 1)) * 43s (min(`maxDelay`, (11s * `multiplier`) +/- rand(`jitter`)) => min(100, (11 * 4) - 1)) * 100s (min(`maxDelay`, (43s * `multiplier`) +/- rand(`jitter`)) => min(100, (43 * 4) + 0)) * 100s (min(`maxDelay`, (100s * `multiplier`) +/- rand(`jitter`)) => min(100, (100 * 4) - 1)) `Transition` definition can have two types, either `string` or `object`. If `string`, it defines the name of the state to transition to. This can be used as a short-cut definition when you don't need to define any other parameters, for example: ```json "transition": "myNextState" ``` If you need to define additional parameters in your `transition` definition, you can define it with its `object` type which has the following properties: | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | [nextState](#Transitions) | Name of the state to transition to next | string | yes | | [compensate](#Workflow-Compensation) | If set to `true`, triggers workflow compensation before this transition is taken. Default is `false` | boolean | no | | produceEvents | Array of [producedEvent](#ProducedEvent-Definition) definitions. Events to be produced before the transition takes place | array | no | <details><summary><strong>Click to view example definition</strong></summary> <p> <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> ```json { "produceEvents": [{ "eventRef": "produceResultEvent", "data": "${ .result.data }" }], "nextState": "EvalResultState" } ``` </td> <td valign="top"> ```yaml produceEvents: - eventRef: produceResultEvent data: "${ .result.data }" nextState: EvalResultState ``` </td> </tr> </table> </details> The `nextState` property defines the name of the state to transition to next. The `compensate` property allows you to trigger [compensation](#Workflow-Compensation) before the transition (if set to `true`). The `produceEvents` property allows you to define a list of events to produce before the transition happens. Transitions allow you to move from one state (control-logic block) to another. For more information see the [Transitions section](#Transitions) section. | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | name | Data condition name | string | no | | [condition](#Workflow-Expressions) | Workflow expression evaluated against state data.

The `condition` property of the condition defines an expression (e.g., `${ .applicant | .age > 18 }`), which selects parts of the state data input. The condition must evaluate to `true` or `false`. If the condition is evaluated to `true`, you can specify either the `transition` or `end` definitions to decide what to do, transition to another workflow state, or end Workflow Execution. Note that `transition` and `end` definitions are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can specify either one or the other, but not both. | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | name | Event condition name | string | no | | eventRef | References an unique event name in the defined workflow events | string | yes | | [transition](#Transitions) | Transition to another state if condition is `true` | string or object | yes (if `end` is not defined) | | [end](#End-Definition) | End Workflow Execution if condition is `true` | boolean or object | yes (if `transition` is not defined) | | [eventDataFilter](#Event-data-filters) | Event data filter definition | object | no | | [metadata](#Workflow-Metadata) | Metadata information| object | no | <details><summary><strong>Click to view example definition</strong></summary> <p> <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> ```json { "name": "Visa approved", "eventRef": "visaApprovedEvent", "transition": "HandleApprovedVisa" } ``` </td> <td valign="top"> ```yaml name: Visa approved eventRef: visaApprovedEvent transition: HandleApprovedVisa ``` </td> </tr> </table> </details> Switch state event conditions specify events, which the switch state must wait for. Each condition can reference one workflow-defined event. Upon arrival of this event, the associated transition is taken. The `eventRef` property references a name of one of the defined workflow events. If the referenced event is received, you can specify either the `transition` or `end` definitions to decide what to do, transition to another workflow state, or end Workflow Execution. The `eventDataFilter` property can be used to filter event data when it is received. Note that `transition` and `end` definitions are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can specify either one or the other, but not both. | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | name | Branch name | string | yes | | [actions](#Action-Definition) | Actions to be executed in this branch | array | yes | | [timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) | Branch specific timeout settings | object | no | <details><summary><strong>Click to view example definition</strong></summary> <p> <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> ```json { "name": "Branch1", "actions": [ { "functionRef": { "refName": "functionNameOne", "arguments": { "order": "${ .someParam }" } } }, { "functionRef": { "refName": "functionNameTwo", "arguments": { "order": "${ .someParamTwo }" } } } ] } ``` </td> <td valign="top"> ```yaml name: Branch1 actions: - functionRef: refName: functionNameOne arguments: order: "${ .someParam }" - functionRef: refName: functionNameTwo arguments: order: "${ .someParamTwo }" ``` </td> </tr> </table> </details> Each branch receives the same copy of the Parallel state's data input. A branch can define actions that need to be executed. For the [`SubFlowRef`](#SubFlowRef-Definition) action, the workflow id should not be the same id of the workflow where the branch is defined. Otherwise, it may occur undesired recurring calls to the same workflow. The `timeouts` property can be used to set branch specific timeout settings. Parallel state branches can set the `actionExecTimeout` and `branchExecTimeout` timeout properties. For more information on workflow timeouts reference the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section. Exceptions can occur during execution of Parallel state branches. By default, exceptions that are not handled within branches stop branch execution and are propagated to the Parallel state and should be handled with its `onErrors` definition. If the parallel states branch defines actions, all exceptions that arise from executing these actions (after all allotted retries are exhausted) are propagated to the parallel state and can be handled with the parallel states `onErrors` definition. If the parallel states defines a subflow action, exceptions that occur during execution of the called workflow can choose to handle exceptions on their own. All unhandled exceptions from the called workflow execution however are propagated back to the parallel state and can be handled with the parallel states `onErrors` definition. Note that once an error that is propagated to the parallel state from a branch and handled by the states `onErrors` definition is handled (its associated transition is taken) no further errors from branches of this parallel state should be considered as the workflow control flow logic has already moved to a different state. For more information, see the [Workflow Error Handling](#Workflow-Error-Handling) sections. Can be either `string` or `object` type. If type string, it defines the name of the workflow starting state. ```json "start": "MyStartingState" ``` In this case it's assumed that the `schedule` property is not defined. If the start definition is of type `object`, it has the following structure: | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | stateName | Name of the starting workflow state | string | no | | [schedule](#Schedule-Definition) | Define the recurring time intervals or cron expressions at which workflow instances should be automatically started. | string or object | yes | <details><summary><strong>Click to view example definition</strong></summary> <p> <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> ```json { "stateName": "MyStartingstate", "schedule": "2020-03-20T09:00:00Z/PT2H" } ``` </td> <td valign="top"> ```yaml stateName: MyStartingstate schedule: 2020-03-20T09:00:00Z/PT2H ``` </td> </tr> </table> </details> Start definition explicitly defines how/when workflow instances should be created and what the workflow starting state is. The start definition can be either `string` or `object` type. If `string` type, it defines the name of the workflow starting state. If `object` type, it provides the ability to set the workflow starting state name, as well as the `schedule` property. The `stateName` property can be set to define the starting workflow state. If not specified, the first state in the [workflow states definition](#Workflow-States) should be used as the starting workflow state. The `schedule` property allows to define scheduled workflow instance creation. Scheduled starts have two different choices. You can define a recurring time interval or cron-based schedule at which a workflow instance **should** be created (automatically). You can also define cron-based scheduled starts, which allows you to specify periodically started workflow instances based on a [cron](http://crontab.org/) definition. Cron-based scheduled starts can handle absolute time intervals (i.e., not calculated in respect to some particular point in time). One use case for cron-based scheduled starts is a workflow that performs periodical data batch processing. In this case we could use a cron definition ``` text 0 0/5 * * * ? ``` to define that a workflow instance from the workflow definition should be created every 5 minutes, starting at full hour. Here are some more examples of cron expressions and their meanings: ``` text * * * * * - Create workflow instance at the top of every minute 0 * * * * - Create workflow instance at the top of every hour 0 */2 * * * - Create workflow instance every 2 hours 0 9 8 * * - Create workflow instance at 9:00:00AM on the eighth day of every month ``` [See here](http://crontab.org/) to get more information on defining cron expressions. One thing to discuss when dealing with cron-based scheduled starts is when the workflow starting state is an [Event](#Event-State). Event states define that workflow instances are triggered by the existence of the defined event(s). Defining a cron-based scheduled starts for the runtime implementations would mean that there needs to be an event service that issues the needed events at the defined times to trigger workflow instance creation. Defining a start definition is not required. If it's not defined, the starting workflow state has to be the very first state defined in the [workflow states array](#Workflow-States). `Schedule` definition can have two types, either `string` or `object`. If `string` type, it defines time interval describing when the workflow instance should be automatically created. This can be used as a short-cut definition when you don't need to define any other parameters, for example: ```json { "schedule": "R/PT2H" } ``` If you need to define the `cron` or the `timezone` parameters in your `schedule` definition, you can define it with its `object` type which has the following properties: | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | interval | A recurring time interval expressed in the derivative of ISO 8601 format specified below. Declares that workflow instances should be automatically created at the start of each time interval in the series. | string | yes (if `cron` is not defined) | | [cron](#Cron-Definition) | Cron expression defining when workflow instances should be automatically created | object | yes (if `interval` is not defined) | | timezone | Timezone name used to evaluate the interval & cron-expression. If the interval specifies a date-time w/ timezone then proper timezone conversion will be applied. (default: UTC). | string | no | <details><summary><strong>Click to view example definition</strong></summary> <p> <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> ```json { "cron": "0 0/15 * * * ?" } ``` </td> <td valign="top"> ```yaml cron: 0 0/15 * * * ? ``` </td> </tr> </table> </details> The `interval` property uses a derivative of ISO 8601 recurring time interval format to describe a series of consecutive time intervals for workflow instances to be automatically created at the start of. Unlike full ISO 8601, this derivative format does not allow expression of an explicit number of recurrences or identification of a series by the date and time at the start and end of its first time interval. There are three ways to express a recurring interval: 1. `R/<Start>/<Duration>`: Defines the start time and a duration, for example: "R/2020-03-20T13:00:00Z/PT2H", meaning workflow instances will be automatically created every 2 hours starting from March 20th 2020 at 1pm UTC. 2. `R/<Duration>/<End>`: Defines a duration and an end, for example: "R/PT2H/2020-05-11T15:30:00Z", meaning that workflow instances will be automatically created every 2 hours until until May 11th 2020 at 3:30pm UTC (i.e., the last instance will be created 2 hours prior to that, at 1:30pm UTC). 3. `R/<Duration>`: Defines a duration only, for example: "R/PT2H", meaning workflow instances will be automatically created every 2 hours. The start time of the first interval may be indeterminate, but should be delayed by no more than the specified duration and must repeat on schedule after that (this is effectively supplying the start time "out-of-band" as permitted ISO ISO 8601-1:2019 section 5.6.1 NOTE 1). Each runtime implementation should document how the start time for a duration-only interval is established. The `cron` property uses a [cron expression](http://crontab.org/) to describe a repeating interval upon which a workflow instance should be created automatically. For more information see the [cron definition](#Cron-Definition) section. The `timezone` property is used to define a time zone name to evaluate the cron or interval expression against. If not specified, it should default to UTC time zone. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) for a list of timezone names. For ISO 8601 date time values in `interval` or `cron.validUntil`, runtimes should treat `timezone` as the 'local time' (UTC if `timezone` is not defined by the user). Note that when the workflow starting state is an [Event](#Event-State) defining cron-based scheduled starts for the runtime implementations would mean that there needs to be an event service that issues the needed events at the defined times to trigger workflow instance creation. `Cron` definition can have two types, either `string` or `object`. If `string` type, it defines the cron expression describing when the workflow instance should be created (automatically). This can be used as a short-cut definition when you don't need to define any other parameters, for example: ```json { "cron": "0 15,30,45 * ? * *" } ``` If you need to define the `validUntil` parameters in your `cron` definition, you can define it with its `object` type which has the following properties: | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | expression | Cron expression describing when the workflow instance should be created (automatically) | string | yes | | validUntil | Specific date and time (ISO 8601 format) when the cron expression is no longer valid | string | no | <details><summary><strong>Click to view example definition</strong></summary> <p> <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> ```json { "expression": "0 15,30,45 * ? * *", "validUntil": "2021-11-05T08:15:30-05:00" } ``` </td> <td valign="top"> ```yaml expression: 0 15,30,45 * ? * * validUntil: '2021-11-05T08:15:30-05:00' ``` </td> </tr> </table> </details> The `expression` property is a a [cron expression](http://crontab.org/) which defines when workflow instances should be created (automatically). The `validUntil` property defines a date and time (using ISO 8601 format). When the `validUntil` time is reached, the cron expression for instances creations of this workflow should no longer be valid. For example let's say we have to following cron definitions: ```json { "expression": "0 15,30,45 * ? * *", "validUntil": "2021-11-05T08:15:30-05:00" } ``` This tells the runtime engine to create an instance of this workflow every hour at minutes 15, 30 and 45. This is to be done until November 5, 2021, 8:15:30 am, US Eastern Standard Time as defined by the `validUntil` property value. Can be either `boolean` or `object` type. If type boolean, must be set to `true`, for example: ```json "end": true ``` In this case it's assumed that the `terminate` property has its default value of `false`, and the `produceEvents`, `compensate`, and `continueAs` properties are not defined. If the end definition is of type `object`, it has the following structure: | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | terminate | If `true`. terminates workflow instance execution | boolean | no | | produceEvents | Array of [producedEvent](#ProducedEvent-Definition) definitions. Defines events that should be produced. | array | no | | [compensate](#Workflow-Compensation) | If set to `true`, triggers workflow compensation before Workflow Execution completes. Default is `false` | boolean | no | | [continueAs](#continuing-as-a-new-execution) | Defines that current Workflow Execution should stop, and execution should continue as a new workflow instance of the provided id | string or object | no | <details><summary><strong>Click to view example definition</strong></summary> <p> <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> ```json { "terminate": true, "produceEvents": [{ "eventRef": "provisioningCompleteEvent", "data": "${ .provisionedOrders }" }] } ``` </td> <td valign="top"> ```yaml terminate: true produceEvents: - eventRef: provisioningCompleteEvent data: "${ .provisionedOrders }" ``` </td> </tr> </table> </details> End definitions are used to explicitly define execution completion of a workflow instance or Workflow Execution path. A workflow definition must include at least one [workflow state](#Workflow-States). Note that [Switch states](#Switch-State) cannot declare to be workflow end states. Their conditions however can define a stop of Workflow Execution. The `terminate` property, if set to `true`, completes the workflow instance execution, this any other active execution paths. If a terminate end is reached inside a ForEach or Parallel state the entire workflow instance is terminated. The [`produceEvents`](#ProducedEvent-Definition) allows defining events which should be produced by the workflow instance before workflow stops its execution. It's important to mention that if the workflow `keepActive` property is set to`true`, the only way to complete execution of the workflow instance is if Workflow Execution reaches a state that defines an end definition with `terminate` property set to `true`, or, if the [`workflowExecTimeout`](#Workflow-Timeouts) property is defined, the time defined in its `interval` is reached. The [compensate](#Workflow-Compensation) property defines that workflow compensation should be performed before the workflow execution is completed. The [continueAs](#Continuing-as-a-new-Execution) property defines that the current workflow instance should stop its execution, and worklow execution should continue as a new instance of a new workflow. When defined, it should be assumed that `terminate` is `true`. If `continueAs` is defined, and `terminate` is explicitly set to `false`, runtimes should report this to users. Producing events, and compensation should still be performed (if defined) before the Workflow Execution is stopped, and continued as a new workflow instance with the defined workflow id. | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | eventRef | Reference to a defined unique event name in the [events](#Event-Definition) definition | string | yes | | data | If string type, an expression which selects parts of the states data output to become the data (payload) of the produced event.

The `eventRef` property must match the name of one of the defined `produced` events in the [events](#Event-Definition) definition. The `data` property can have two types, object or string. If of string type, it is an expression that can select parts of state data to be used as the event payload. If of object type, you can define a custom object to be the event payload. The `contextAttributes` property allows you to add one or more [extension context attributes](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md#extension-context-attributes) to the generated event. Being able to produce events when Workflow Execution completes or during state transition allows for event-based orchestration communication. For example, completion of an orchestration workflow can notify other orchestration workflows to decide if they need to act upon the produced event, or notify monitoring services of the current state of Workflow Execution, etc. It can be used to create very dynamic orchestration scenarios. Serverless workflow states can have one or more incoming and outgoing transitions (from/to other states). Each state can define a `transition` definition that is used to determine which state to transition to next. Implementers **must** use the unique State `name` property for determining the transition. Events can be produced during state transitions. The `produceEvents` property of the `transition` definitions allows you to reference one or more defined `produced` events in the workflow [events definitions](#Event-Definition). For each of the produced events you can select what parts of state data to be the event payload. Transitions can trigger compensation via their `compensate` property. See the [Workflow Compensation](#Workflow-Compensation) section for more information. Specifying additional properties, namely properties which are not defined by the specification are only allowed in the [Workflow Definition](#Workflow-Definition-Structure). Additional properties serve the same purpose as [Workflow Metadata](#Workflow-Metadata). They allow you to enrich the workflow definition with custom information. Additional properties, just like workflow metadata, should not affect Workflow Execution. Implementations may choose to use additional properties or ignore them. It is recommended to use workflow metadata instead of additional properties in the workflow definition. Let's take a look at an example of additional properties: ```json { "id": "myworkflow", "version": "1.0.0", "specVersion": "0.8", "name": "My Test Workflow", "start": "My First State", "loglevel": "Info", "environment": "Production", "category": "Sales", "states": [ ... ] } ``` In this example, we specify the `loglevel`, `environment`, and `category` additional properties. Note the same can be also specified using workflow metadata, which is the preferred approach: ```json { "id": "myworkflow", "version": "1.0.0", "specVersion": "0.8", "name": "Py Test Workflow", "start": "My First State", "metadata": { "loglevel": "Info", "environment": "Production", "category": "Sales" }, "states": [ ... ] } ``` Serverless Workflow language allows you to define `explicit` error handling, meaning you can define what should happen in case of errors inside your workflow model rather than some generic error handling entity. This allows error handling to become part of your orchestration activities and as such part of your business problem solutions. The idea behind the way Serverless Workflow defines error handling is that workflows should only fail due to unknown bugs during execution. In general, you should always write your workflows so that they do not fail on any known failures. Each workflow state can define error handling, which is related only to errors that may arise during its execution. Error handling defined in one state cannot be used to handle errors that happened during execution of another state during Workflow Execution. Unknown errors that may arise during workflow state execution that are not explicitly handled within the workflow definition should be reported by runtime implementations and halt Workflow Execution. Within workflow definitions, errors defined are `domain specific`, meaning they are defined within the actual business domain, rather than their technical (programming-language-specific) description. For example, we can define errors such as "Order not found", or "Item not in inventory", rather than having to use terms such as "java.lang.IllegalAccessError", or "response.status == 404", which might make little to no sense to our specific problem domain, as well as may not be portable across various runtime implementations. In addition to the domain specific error name, users have the option to also add an optional error code to help runtime implementations with mapping defined errors to concrete underlying technical ones. Runtime implementations must be able to map the error domain specific name (and the optional error code) to concrete technical errors that arise during Workflow Execution. Known workflow errors, that we know we need to handle during Workflow Execution should be defined in the workflow top-level 'errors' property. This property can be either a string type, meaning it can reference a reusable JSON or Yaml definition file including the error definitions, or it can have an array type where you can define these checked errors in-line in your workflow definition. Here is an example of such a definition for both cases: 1. Referencing a reusable JSON/Yaml error definition file: <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> ```json { "errors": "file://documents/reusable/errors.json" } ``` </td> <td valign="top"> ```yaml errors: file://documents/reusable/errors.json ``` </td> </tr> </table> 2. Defining workflow errors in-line: <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> ```json { "errors": [ { "name": "Service not found error", "code": "404", "description": "Server has not found anything matching the provided service endpoint information" } ] } ``` </td> <td valign="top"> ```yaml errors: - name: Service not found error code: '404' description: Server has not found anything matching the provided service endpoint information ``` </td> </tr> </table> These defined errors can then be referenced by their unique name in both states `onErrors` definitions as well as in actions `nonRetryableErrors` and `retryableErrors` properties. Retries allow workflows to deal with intermittent failures of services they are trying to invoke. In addition, retries allow workflows to continue (not fail) execution and allow us to fix possible errors with invoked services and continue execution after they are fixed. Retries are important for both short-lived and long-lived workflows, as well as in both stateless and stateful scenarios. Serverless workflow supports two distinct ways of defining retries: 1. Retrying on specified known (checked) errors. 2. Automatic retrying on both known (checked) and not-known (unchecked) errors. Which retry option the workflow should use by default is defined via the workflow top-level `autoRetries` property. By default, the value of the `autoRetries` is set to `false`, meaning that retry option 1) is used by default. You can enable automatic retrying (option 2) by setting `autoRetries` to `true`. Regardless of the chosen retries option, note that workflows in general should be designed to not fail. Workflows should be able to recover from intermittent failures. The next sections provide more details to each action retry option. This is the default option when the workflow top-level `autoRetries` property is not specified or is set to `false`. This retry options is suited for stateless / short-running workflows where retries should be performed when specifically wanted. Note that in this scenario when unknown (unchecked) errors happen during action execution (service invocation), Workflow Execution should fail. Let's take a look at an example. To start, let's define a workflow top-level `retries` definition: <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> ```json { "retries": [ { "name": "FirstRetryStrategy", "delay": "PT1M", "maxAttempts": 5 }, { "name": "SecondRetryStrategy", "delay": "PT10M", "maxAttempts": 10 } ] } ``` </td> <td valign="top"> ```yaml retries: - name: FirstRetryStrategy delay: PT1M maxAttempts: 5 - name: SecondRetryStrategy delay: PT10M maxAttempts: 10 ``` </td> </tr> </table> Our `retries` definitions can be referenced by actions. For example: <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> ```json { "actions": [ { "functionRef": "MyFirstFunction", "retryRef": "FirstRetryStrategy", "retryableErrors": ["SomeErrorOne", "SomeErrorTwo"] }, { "functionRef": "MySecondFunction", "retryRef": "SecondRetryStrategy", "retryableErrors": ["SomeErrorTwo", "SomeErrorThree"] }, { "functionRef": "MyThirdFunction" } ] } ``` </td> <td valign="top"> ```yaml actions: - functionRef: MyFirstFunction retryRef: FirstRetryStrategy nonRetryableErrors: - SomeErrorOne - SomeErrorTwo - functionRef: MySecondFunction retryRef: SecondRetryStrategy nonRetryableErrors: - SomeErrorTwo - SomeErrorThree - functionRef: MyThirdFunction ``` </td> </tr> </table> Each action can define the retry strategy it wants to use. If it does not define one, the action is in this case not retries. Actions can define a list of known errors in its `retryableErrors` array. If defined, then the action should be retried for those errors according to the referenced retry strategy. In our example, "MyFirstFunction" invocation should be retried according to the "FirstRetryStrategy" policy only on known errors "SomeErrorOne" and "SomeErrorTwo". If for a known error (defined in `retryableErrors`) the retry limit is reached and the error still persist, it can be handled in the states `onErrors` definition. If an unknown (unchecked) error happens during action execution, and this error is also not handled in the states `onErrors` definition, the Workflow Execution should fail. This is the option used when the workflow top-level `autoRetries` property is set to `true`. Automatic retries are well suited to long-running and stateful workflow orchestrations. It allows workflows to recover from failures thus providing more resilience. There is a possible cost associated with automatic retries in terms of resource and computing power utilization. With this retries option, action executions should be retried automatically for both known (checked) as well as unknown (unchecked) errors. This means that you do not have to define a retry strategy for actions for them to have retried, it's included by default. Users can still define a custom retry strategy for each action via the `retryRef` property. If a retry strategy is not defined, a default retry strategy should be used. Runtime implementations can define their own default retry strategy. Serverless Workflow recommends the following settings: * `maxAttempts` to be `unlimited`, meaning that the action should be retried indefinitely until successful. * `delay` to be set to one second, meaning that there is a one second delay between action retries. * `multiplier` to be set to two meaning that the delay should be multiplied by two for each retry attempt. Runtimes should document their default retry strategy to users, so it's clear which property values they are using for the default. Actions can define for which known (checked) errors they should not be retried for. This is done via the actions `nonRetryableErrors` property. If a known error happens during action execution which is included in the `nonRetryableErrors` property array, that action should not be retried and the error then should be handled in the workflow states `onErrors` property. Let's take a look at an examples of defining retries when using the automatic retries option. This example assumes that the workfow top level `autoRetries` property is set to `true`. To start, let's define a workflow top-level `retries` definition: <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> ```json { "retries": [ { "name": "FirstRetryStrategy", "delay": "PT1M", "maxAttempts": 5 }, { "name": "SecondRetryStrategy", "delay": "PT10M", "maxAttempts": 10 }, { "name": "DoNotRetryStrategy", "maxAttempts": 1 } ] } ``` </td> <td valign="top"> ```yaml retries: - name: FirstRetryStrategy delay: PT1M maxAttempts: 5 - name: SecondRetryStrategy delay: PT10M maxAttempts: 10 - name: DoNotRetryStrategy maxAttempts: 1 ``` </td> </tr> </table> Our retry definitions can be referenced by state actions. For example: <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> ```json { "actions": [ { "functionRef": "MyFirstFunction", "retryRef": "FirstRetryStrategy", "nonRetryableErrors": ["SomeErrorOne", "SomeErrorTwo"] }, { "functionRef": "MySecondFunction", "retryRef": "SecondRetryStrategy", "nonRetryableErrors": ["SomeErrorTwo", "SomeErrorThree"] }, { "functionRef": "MyThirdFunction" }, { "functionRef": "MyFourthFunction", "retryRef": "DoNotRetryStrategy" } ] } ``` </td> <td valign="top"> ```yaml actions: - functionRef: MyFirstFunction retryRef: FirstRetryStrategy nonRetryableErrors: - SomeErrorOne - SomeErrorTwo - functionRef: MySecondFunction retryRef: SecondRetryStrategy nonRetryableErrors: - SomeErrorTwo - SomeErrorThree - functionRef: MyThirdFunction - functionRef: MyFourthFunction retryRef: DoNotRetryStrategy ``` </td> </tr> </table> In our example the first action named `MyFirstFunction` is going to be retried according to the `FirstRetryStrategy` retry policy for all errors except `SomeErrorOne` and `SomeErrorTwo`. The seconds action named `MySecondFunction` is going to be retried according to the `SecondRetryStrategy` retry policy for all errors except `SomeErrorTwo` and `SomeErrorThree`. The third action named `MyThirdFunction` is going to retried according to the default runtime retry policy. It will be retried for all errors both known (checked) as well as unknown (unckecked). The fourth action named `MyFourthFunction` is going to be retried according to the `DoNotRetryStrategy` retry policy which has the `maxAttempts` property set to `1`, meaning that this action will not be retried. Workflow timeouts define the maximum times for: 1. Workflow execution 2. State execution 3. Action execution 4. Branch execution 5. Event consumption time The specification allows for timeouts to be defined on the top-level workflow definition, as well as in each of the workflow state definitions. Note that the timeout settings defined in states, and state branches overwrite the top-level workflow definition for state, action and branch execution. If they are not defined, then the top-level timeout settings should take in effect. To give an example, let's say that in our workflow definition we define the timeout for state execution: ```json { "id": "testWorkflow", ... "timeouts": { ... "stateExecTimeout": "PT2S" } ... } ``` This top-level workflow timeout setting defines that the maximum execution time of all defined workflow states is two seconds each. Now let's say that we have worfklow states "A" and "B". State "A" does not define a timeout definition, but state "B" does: ```json { "name": "B", "type": "operation", ... "timeouts": { ... "stateExecTimeout": "PT10S" } ... } ``` Since state "A" does not overwrite the top-level `stateExecTimeout`, its execution timeout should be inherited from the top-level timeout definition. On the other hand, state "B" does define it's own `stateExecTimeout`, in which case it would overwrite the default setting, meaning that it would its execution time has a max limit of ten seconds. Defining timeouts is not mandatory, meaning that if not defined, all the timeout settings should be assumed to be "unlimited". Note that the defined Workflow Execution timeout has precedence over all other defined timeouts. Just to give an extreme example, let's say we define the Workflow Execution timeout to ten seconds, and the state execution timeout to twenty seconds. In this case if the Workflow Execution timeout is reached it should follow the rules of Workflow Execution timeout and end Workflow Execution, no matter what the state execution time has been set to. Let's take a look all possible timeout definitions: Workflow timeouts are defined with the top-level `timeouts` property. It can have two types, `string` and `object`. If `string` type it defines an URI that points to a Json or Yaml file containing the workflow timeout definitions. If `object` type, it is used to define the timeout definitions in-line and has the following properties: | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | [workflowExecTimeout](#workflowexectimeout-definition) | Workflow execution timeout (ISO 8601 duration format) | string or object | no | | [stateExecTimeout](#states-timeout-definition) | Workflow state execution timeout (ISO 8601 duration format) | string | no | | actionExecTimeout | Actions execution timeout (ISO 8601 duration format) | string | no | | [branchExecTimeout](#branch-timeout-definition) | Branch execution timeout (ISO 8601 duration format) | string | no | | [eventTimeout](#event-timeout-definition) | Default timeout for consuming defined events (ISO 8601 duration format) | string | no | The `eventTimeout` property defines the maximum amount of time to wait to consume defined events. If not specified it should default to "unlimited". The `branchExecTimeout` property defines the maximum execution time for a single branch. If not specified it should default to "unlimited". The `actionExecTimeout` property defines the maximum execution time for a single actions definition. If not specified it should default to "unlimited". Note that an action definition can include multiple actions. The `stateExecTimeout` property defines the maximum execution time for a single workflow state. If not specified it should default to "unlimited". The `workflowExecTimeout` property defines the Workflow Execution timeout. It is defined using the ISO 8601 duration format. If not defined, the Workflow Execution should be given "unlimited" amount of time to complete. `workflowExecTimeout` can have two possibly types, either `string` or `object`. If `string` type, it defines the maximum Workflow Execution time. If Object type it has the following format: | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | duration | Timeout duration (ISO 8601 duration format) | string | yes | | interrupt | If `false`, workflow instance is allowed to finish current execution. If `true`, current Workflow Execution is stopped immediately. Default is `false` | boolean | no | | runBefore | Name of a workflow state to be executed before workflow instance is terminated | string | no | <details><summary><strong>Click to view example definition</strong></summary> <p> <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> ```json { "duration": "PT2M", "runBefore": "createandsendreport" } ``` </td> <td valign="top"> ```yaml duration: PT2M runBefore: createandsendreport ``` </td> </tr> </table> </details> The `duration` property defines the time duration of the execution timeout. Once a workflow instance is created, and the amount of the defined time is reached, the workflow instance should be terminated. The `interrupt` property defines if the currently running instance should be allowed to finish its current execution flow before it needs to be terminated. If set to `true`, the current instance execution should stop immediately. The `runBefore` property defines a name of a workflow state to be executed before workflow instance is terminated. States referenced by `runBefore` (as well as any other states that they transition to) must obey following rules: * They should not have any incoming transitions (should not be part of the main workflow control-flow logic) * They cannot be states marked for compensation (have their `usedForCompensation` property set to `true`) * If it is a single state, it must define an [end definition](#End-Definition), if it transitions to other states, at last one must define it. * They can transition only to states are also not part of the main control flow logic (and are not marked for compensation). Runtime implementations should raise compile time / parsing exceptions if any of the rules mentioned above are not obeyed in the workflow definition. All workflow states except Sleep and Inject States can define the `timeouts` property and can define different timeout settings depending on their state type. Please reference each [workflow state definitions](#Workflow-States) for more information on which timeout settings are available for each state type. Workflow states timeouts cannot define the `workflowExecTimeout` property. Workflow states can set their `stateExecTimeout` property inside the `timeouts` definition. The value of this property is a time duration (ISO 8601 duration format). It must be a duration that's greater than zero and defines the total state execution timeout. When this timeout is reached, state execution should be stopped and can be handled as a timeout error in the states `onErrors` definition. [Parallel states](#Parallel-State) can define the `branchExecTimeout` property. If defined on the state level, it applies to each [branch](#Parallel-State-Branch) of the Parallel state. Note that each parallel state branch can overwrite this setting to define its own branch execution timeout. If a branch does not define this timeout property, it should be inherited from it's state definition branch timeout setting. If its state does not define it either, it should be inherited from the top-level workflow branch timeout settings. The Event state `timeouts` property can be used to specify state specific timeout settings. For event state it can contain the `eventTimeout` property which is defined using the ISO 8601 data and time format. You can specify for example "PT15M" to represent 15 minutes or "P2DT3H4M" to represent 2 days, 3 hours and 4 minutes. `eventTimeout` values should always be represented as durations and not as specific time intervals. The `eventTimeout` property needs to be described in detail for Event states as it depends on whether or not the Event state is a workflow starting state or not. If the Event state is a workflow starting state, incoming events may trigger workflow instances. In this case, if the `exclusive` property is set to `true`, the `eventTimeout` property should be ignored. If the `exclusive` property is set to `false`, in this case, the defined `eventTimeout` represents the time between arrival of specified events. To give an example, consider the following: ```json { "states": [ { "name": "ExampleEventState", "type": "event", "exclusive": false, "timeouts": { "eventTimeout": "PT2M" } "onEvents": [ { "eventRefs": [ "ExampleEvent1", "ExampleEvent2" ], "actions": [ ... ] } ], "end": { "terminate": true } } ] } ``` The first `eventTimeout` would start once any of the referenced events are consumed. If the second event does not occur within the defined eventTimeout, no workflow instance should be created. If the event state is not a workflow starting state, the `eventTimeout` property is relative to the time when the state becomes active. If the defined event conditions (regardless of the value of the exclusive property) are not satisfied within the defined timeout period, the event state should transition to the next state or end the workflow instance in case it is an end state without performing any actions. Compensation deals with undoing or reversing the work of one or more states which have already successfully completed. For example, let's say that we have charged a customer $100 for an item purchase. In the case customer laster on decides to cancel this purchase we need to undo it. One way of doing that is to credit the customer $100. It's important to understand that compensation with workflows is not the same as for example rolling back a transaction (a strict undo). Compensating a workflow state which has successfully completed might involve multiple logical steps and thus is part of the overall business logic that must be defined within the workflow itself. To explain this let's use our previous example and say that when our customer made the item purchase, our workflow has sent her/him a confirmation email. In the case, to compensate this purchase, we cannot just "undo" the confirmation email sent. Instead, we want to send a second email to the customer which includes purchase cancellation information. Compensation in Serverless Workflow must be explicitly defined by the workflow control flow logic. It cannot be dynamically triggered by initial workflow data, event payloads, results of service invocations, or errors. Each workflow state can define how it should be compensated via its `compensatedBy` property. This property references another workflow state (by its unique name) which is responsible for the actual compensation. States referenced by `compensatedBy` (as well as any other states that they transition to) must obey following rules: * They should not have any incoming transitions (should not be part of the main workflow control-flow logic) * They cannot be an [event state](#Event-State) * They cannot define an [end definition](#End-definition). If they do, it should be ignored * They must define the `usedForCompensation` property and set it to `true` * They can transition only to states which also have their `usedForCompensation` property set to `true` * They cannot themselves set their `compensatedBy` property to any state (compensation is not recursive) Runtime implementations should raise compile time / parsing exceptions if any of the rules mentioned above are not obeyed in the workflow definition. Let's take a look at an example workflow state which defines its `compensatedBy` property, and the compensation state it references: <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> ```json { "states": [ { "name": "NewItemPurchase", "type": "event", "onEvents": [ { "eventRefs": [ "NewPurchase" ], "actions": [ { "functionRef": { "refName": "DebitCustomerFunction", "arguments": { "customerid": "${ .purchase.customerid }", "amount": "${ .purchase.amount }" } } }, { "functionRef": { "refName": "SendPurchaseConfirmationEmailFunction", "arguments": { "customerid": "${ .purchase.customerid }" } } } ] } ], "compensatedBy": "CancelPurchase", "transition": "SomeNextWorkflowState" }, { "name": "CancelPurchase", "type": "operation", "usedForCompensation": true, "actions": [ { "functionRef": { "refName": "CreditCustomerFunction", "arguments": { "customerid": "${ .purchase.customerid }", "amount": "${ .purchase.amount }" } } }, { "functionRef": { "refName": "SendPurchaseCancellationEmailFunction", "arguments": { "customerid": "${ .purchase.customerid }" } } } ] } ] } ``` </td> <td valign="top"> ```yaml states: - name: NewItemPurchase type: event onEvents: - eventRefs: - NewPurchase actions: - functionRef: refName: DebitCustomerFunction arguments: customerid: "${ .purchase.customerid }" amount: "${ .purchase.amount }" - functionRef: refName: SendPurchaseConfirmationEmailFunction arguments: customerid: "${ .purchase.customerid }" compensatedBy: CancelPurchase transition: SomeNextWorkflowState - name: CancelPurchase type: operation usedForCompensation: true actions: - functionRef: refName: CreditCustomerFunction arguments: customerid: "${ .purchase.customerid }" amount: "${ .purchase.amount }" - functionRef: refName: SendPurchaseCancellationEmailFunction arguments: customerid: "${ .purchase.customerid }" ``` </td> </tr> </table> In this example our "NewItemPurchase" [event state](#Event-state) waits for a "NewPurchase" event and then debits the customer and sends them a purchase confirmation email. It defines that it's compensated by the "CancelPurchase" [operation state](#Operation-state) which performs two actions, namely credits back the purchase amount to customer and sends them a purchase cancellation email. As previously mentioned, compensation must be explicitly triggered by the workflows control-flow logic. This can be done via [transition](#Transition-definition) and [end](#End-definition) definitions. Let's take a look at each: 1. Compensation triggered on transition: <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> ```json { "transition": { "compensate": true, "nextState": "NextWorkflowState" } } ``` </td> <td valign="top"> ```yaml transition: compensate: true nextState: NextWorkflowState ``` </td> </tr> </table> Transitions can trigger compensations by specifying the `compensate` property and setting it to `true`. This means that before the transition is executed (workflow continues its execution to the "NextWorkflowState" in this example), workflow compensation must be performed. 2. Compensation triggered by end definition: <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> ```json { "end": { "compensate": true } } ``` </td> <td valign="top"> ```yaml end: compensate: true ``` </td> </tr> </table> End definitions can trigger compensations by specifying the `compensate` property and setting it to `true`. This means that before workflow finishes its execution workflow compensation must be performed. Note that in case when the end definition has its `produceEvents` property set, compensation must be performed before producing the specified events and ending Workflow Execution. In the case the end definition has a `continueAs` property defined, compensation must be performed before Workflow Execution continues as a new workflow invocation. In the case where the end definition has both `produceEvents`, and `continueAs` compensation is performed first, then the event should be produced, and then the workflow should continue its execution as a new workflow invocation. Now that we have seen how to define and trigger compensation, we need to go into details on how compensation should be executed. Compensation is performed on all already successfully completed states (that define `compensatedBy`) in **reverse** order. Compensation is always done in sequential order, and should not be executed in parallel. Let's take a look at the following workflow image: <p align="center"> <img src="media/spec/compensation-exec.png" height="400px" alt="Compensation Execution Example"/> </p> In this example lets say our Workflow Execution is at the "End" state which defines the `compensate` property to `true` as shown in the previous section. States with a red border, namely "A", "B", "D" and "E" are states which have so far been executed successfully. State "C" has not been executed during Workflow Execution in our example. When Workflow Execution encounters our "End" state, compensation has to be performed. This is done in **reverse** order: 1. State "E" is not compensated as it does not define a `compensatedBy` state 2. State "D" is compensated by executing compensation "D1" 3. State "B" is compensated by executing "B1" and then "B1-2" 4. State C is not compensated as it was never active during Workflow Execution 5. State A is not comped as it does not define a `compensatedBy` state So if we look just at the Workflow Execution flow, the same workflow could be seen as: <p align="center"> <img src="media/spec/compensation-exec2.png" height="200px" alt="Compensation Execution Example 2"/> </p> In our example, when compensation triggers, the current workflow data is passed as input to the "D1" state, the first compensation state for our example. The states data output is then passed as states data input to "B1", and so on. In some cases when compensation is triggered, some states such as [Parallel](#Parallel-State) and [ForEach](#ForEach-State) states can still be "active", meaning they still might have some async executions that are being performed. If compensation needs to performed on such still active states, the state execution must be first cancelled. After it is cancelled, compensation should be performed. States that are marked as `usedForCompensation` can define [error handling](#Workflow-Error-Handling) via their `onErrors` property just like any other workflow states. In case of unrecoverable errors during their execution (errors not explicitly handled), Workflow Execution should be stopped, which is the same behavior as when not using compensation as well. In some cases our workflows are deployed and executed on runtimes and/or cloud platforms that expose some execution limitations such as finite execution duration, finite number of workflow transitions, etc. Some runtimes, especially when dealing with stateful workflow orchestrations have a finite limit of execution history log sizes, meaning that once a long-running workflow reaches these limits Workflow Executions is likely to be forced to stop before reaching its completion. This can result in unexpected issues, especially with mission-critical workflows. For those cases, the Serverless Workflow DSL provides a way to explicitly define stopping the current workflow instance execution, and starting a new one (for the same workflow id or a different one). This can be done via the [end definitions](#end-definition) `continueAs` property. The end definitions `continueAs` can be either of type `string` or `object`. If string type, it contains the unique workflow id of the workflow that the execution should continue as, for example: ```json { "end": { "continueAs": "myworkflowid" } } ``` Defining this should stop the current Workflow Execution, and continue execution as a new workflow instance of the workflow which defines the workflow id of "myworkflowid". The state data where this is define should become the workflow data input of the workflow that is continuing the current Workflow Execution. Note that any defined `produceEvents` and `compensate` definitions should be honored before `continueAs` is applied. If `object` type, the `continueAs` property has the following properties: | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | workflowId | Unique id of the workflow to continue execution as. | string | yes | | version | Version of the workflow to continue execution as. | string | no | | data | If string type, a workflow expression which selects parts of the states data output to become the workflow data input of continued execution. If object type, a custom object to become the workflow data input of the continued execution. | string or object | no | | [`workflowExecTimeout`](#Workflow-Timeouts) | Workflow execution timeout to be used by the workflow continuing execution. Overwrites any specific settings set by that workflow. | string or object | no | Continuing execution with `continueAs` can also be used inside sub-Workflow Executions, which brings its next use case. Workflows can invoke sub-workflows during their execution. In Serverless Workflow DSL, sub-workflows are invoked similarly to other function types via the [SubFlowRef Definition](#SubFlowRef-Definition) in workflow states [Action](#Action-Definition) definitions. Just like "parent" workflows, sub-workflow can also be long-running, and can run into the same type of runtime/serverless platform limitations as previously discussed. As such they can also use `continueAs` to stop their current execution and continue it as a new one of the same or different workflow id. Note that when a sub-workflow is invoked it can produce a result that is then merged into the parent workflow state data. This may bring up a question as to what happens when a sub-workflow calls `continueAs` in terms of what is returned as result to of its invocation by the parent workflow. No matter how many times sub-workflow may use `continueAs`, to the parent workflow it should be as a single invocation is performed, meaning that the results of the last sub-workflow invocation (triggered by `continueAs`) should be used as the data returned by the invocation of the sub-workflow to the parent workflow. In any application, regardless of size or type, one thing is for sure: changes happen. Versioning your workflow definitions is an important task to consider. Versions indicate changes or updates of your workflow definitions to the associated execution runtimes. There are two places in the [workflow definition](#Workflow-Definition-Structure) where versioning can be applied: 1. Top level workflow definition `version` property. 2. Actions [subflowRef](#SubFlowRef-Definition) `version` property. The `version` property must respect the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) guidelines. Workflow constants are used to define static, and immutable, data which is available to [Workflow Expressions](#Workflow-Expressions). Constants can be defined via the [Workflow top-level "constants" property](#Workflow-Definition-Structure), for example: ```json "constants": { "Translations": { "Dog": { "Serbian": "pas", "Spanish": "perro", "French": "chien" } } } ``` Constants can only be accessed inside Workflow expressions via the `$CONST` variable. Runtimes must make `$CONST` available to expressions as a predefined variable. Here is an example of using constants in Workflow expressions: ```json { ..., "constants": { "AGE": { "MIN_ADULT": 18 } }, ... "states":[ { "name":"CheckApplicant", "type":"switch", "dataConditions": [ { "name": "Applicant is adult", "condition": "${ .applicant | .age >= $CONST.AGE.MIN_ADULT }", "transition": "ApproveApplication" }, { "name": "Applicant is minor", "condition": "${ .applicant | .age < $CONST.AGE.MIN_ADULT }", "transition": "RejectApplication" } ], ... }, ... ] } ``` Note that constants can also be used in [expression functions](#Using-Functions-for-Expression-Evaluation), for example: ```json { "functions": [ { "name": "isAdult", "operation": ".applicant | .age >= $CONST.AGE.MIN_ADULT", "type": "expression" }, { "name": "isMinor", "operation": ".applicant | .age < $CONST.AGE.MIN_ADULT", "type": "expression" } ] } ``` Workflow constants values should only contain static data, meaning that their value should not contain Workflow expressions. Workflow constants data must be immutable. Workflow constants should not have access to [Workflow secrets definitions](#Workflow-Secrets). Secrets allow you access sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, ssh keys, etc inside your [Workflow Expressions](#Workflow-Expressions). You can define the names of secrets via the [Workflow top-level "secrets" property](#Workflow-Definition-Structure), for example: ```json "secrets": ["MY_PASSWORD", "MY_STORAGE_KEY", "MY_ACCOUNT"] ``` If secrets are defined in a Workflow definition, runtimes must assure to provide their values during Workflow execution. Secrets can be used only in [Workflow expressions](#Workflow-Expressions) by referencing them via the `$SECRETS` variable. Runtimes must make `$SECRETS` available to expressions as a predefined variable. Here is an example on how to use secrets and pass them as arguments to a function invocation: ```json "secrets": ["AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT", "AZURE_STORAGE_KEY"], ... { "refName": "uploadToAzure", "arguments": { "account": "${ $SECRETS.AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT }", "account-key": "${ $SECRETS.AZURE_STORAGE_KEY }", ... } } ``` Note that secrets can also be used in [expression functions](#Using-Functions-for-Expression-Evaluation). Secrets are immutable, meaning that workflow expressions are not allowed to change their values. Metadata enables you to enrich the serverless workflow model with information beyond its core definitions. It is intended to be used by clients, such as tools and libraries, as well as users that find this information relevant. Metadata should not affect Workflow Execution. Implementations may choose to use metadata information or ignore it. Note, however, that using metadata to control Workflow Execution can lead to vendor-locked implementations that do not comply with the main goals of this specification, which is to be completely vendor-neutral. Metadata includes key/value pairs (string types). Both keys and values are completely arbitrary and non-identifying. Metadata can be added to: - [Workflow Definition](#Workflow-Definition-Structure) - [Function definitions](#Function-Definition) - [Event definitions](#Event-Definition) - [State definitions](#Workflow-States) - [Switch state](#Switch-State) [data](#Switch-State-Data-Conditions) and [event](#Switch-State-Event-Conditions) conditions. Here is an example of metadata attached to the core workflow definition: ```json { "id": "processSalesOrders", "name": "Process Sales Orders", "version": "1.0.0", "specVersion": "0.8", "start": "MyStartingState", "metadata": { "loglevel": "Info", "environment": "Production", "category": "Sales", "giturl": "github.com/myproject", "author": "Author Name", "team": "Team Name", ... }, "states": [ ... ] } ``` Some other examples of information that could be recorded in metadata are: - UI tooling information such as sizing or scaling factors. - Build, release, or image information such as timestamps, release ids, git branches, PR numbers, etc. - Logging, monitoring, analytics, or audit repository information. - Labels used for organizing/indexing purposes, such as "release" "stable", "track", "daily", etc. Similar to [Constants](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/blob/main/specification.md#workflow-constants) and [Secrets](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/blob/main/specification.md#workflow-secrets), workflows expressions can have access to the context information of a running instance via the keyword `WORKFLOW`. Implementations may use this keyword to give access to any relevant information of the running instance within an expression. For example: ```json { "id": "processSalesOrders", "name": "Process Sales Orders", "version": "1.0.0", "specVersion": "0.8", "start": "MyStartingState", "functions": [{ "name": "myFunction", "operation": "myopenapi.json#myFunction" }], "states":[ { "name":"MyStartingState", "type":"operation", "actions": [{ "functionRef": "myFunction", "args": { "order": "${ .orderId }", "callerId": "${ $WORKFLOW.instanceId }" } }], "end": true }] } ``` In this use case, a third-party service may require information from the caller for traceability purposes. The specification doesn't define any specific variable within the `WORKFLOW` bucket, but it's considered a reserved keyword. The workflow extension mechanism allows you to enhance your model definitions with additional information useful for things like analytics, rate limiting, logging, simulation, debugging, tracing, etc. Model extensions do no influence control flow logic (Workflow Execution semantics). They enhance it with extra information that can be consumed by runtime systems or tooling and evaluated with the end goal being overall workflow improvements in terms of time, cost, efficiency, etc. Serverless Workflow specification provides extensions which can be found [here](extensions/README.md). You can define extensions in your workflow definition using its top-level `extensions` property. For more information about this property, see the `extensions` property in the [Workflow Definition Structure section](#Workflow-Definition-Structure). Even tho users can define their own extensions, it is encouraged to use the ones provided by the specification. We also encourage users to contribute their extensions to the specification. That way they can be shared with the rest of the community. If you have an idea for a new workflow extension, or would like to enhance an existing one, please open an `New Extension Request` issue in this repository. You can find different Serverless Workflow use cases [here](usecases/README.md). You can find many Serverless Workflow examples [here](examples/README.md). You can find info how the Serverless Workflow language compares with other workflow languages [here](comparisons/README.md). You can find a list of other languages, technologies and specifications related to workflows [here](references/README.md).

Each block represents a specific task or operation. Data Connector: The links between process blocks. They represent the flow of data between tasks. Workflow: A sequence of process blocks and data connectors that represents a complete process or task. Simulation: The process of executing a workflow to test its functionality and performance. Deployment: The process of making a workflow operational in a live environment. Debugging: The process of identifying and fixing errors in a workflow. Here are some additional details to expand on the switch state definitions: The switch state allows routing workflow execution based on data or events. Data-based Switch Details The dataConditions array contains objects with: condition - expression evaluated against state data transition - next transition if condition is true For example: "dataConditions": [{ "condition": "${ .orderTotal > 100 }", "transition": "processLargeOrder" }] This routes orders over $100 to the "processLargeOrder" state. Event-based Switch Details The eventConditions array contains objects with: eventRef - name of event transition - next transition if event occurs For example: "eventConditions": [{ "eventRef": "orderCancelled", "transition": "handleCancellation" }] This routes to "handleCancellation" state if "orderCancelled" event occurs. Default Condition The defaultCondition defines the transition if no conditions match. It contains: transition - next transition if no condition matches end - end workflow execution For example: "defaultCondition": { "transition": "fallbackState" } So in summary, switch states allow flexible data-based and event-based routing in workflows.

Maintenance and Support: The skill provides maintenance and support features, including system updates, bug fixes, and user assistance, to ensure the smooth operation of the WMS. By following this logical flow, the WMS skill can effectively manage warehouse operations, optimize processes, and enhance overall productivity. Please note that this is a high-level overview, and the specific implementation details may vary based on the requirements and capabilities of the WMS system. Certainly! Here is a logical flow and sequence of actions that a virtual Genius can follow to provide weather updates: Start: The virtual Genius receives a user request for weather updates. Gather Location Information: The Genius prompts the user to provide the location for which they want to receive weather updates. The Genius captures the user's location input. Retrieve Weather Data: The Genius uses a weather API or service to fetch the current weather data for the specified location The Genius sends a request to the weather API, including the user's location information. Process Weather Data: Certainly! The implementation stage involves writing code for each block in the workflow. Here's a breakdown of the code implementation for each step in the weather update feature: User Input: Prompt the user to enter their desired location for weather updates. Capture the user's input using an input function or a user interface element. Location Validation: Validate the user's input to ensure it is a valid location. Use a validation mechanism such as checking against a list of valid locations or using a geocoding service to verify the location. Weather API Integration: Integrate with a weather API service by making an HTTP request to the API endpoint. Pass the user's location as a parameter in the API request. Handle the API response, which typically comes in JSON format, by parsing the data. Data Processing: Extract relevant information from the weather data received from the API response. Access specific fields in the JSON data structure to retrieve temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. Weather Update Generation: Use the extracted weather information to generate a concise and informative weather update. Format the weather update message according to your desired output format, such as a text string or a structured object. Response Delivery: Provide the weather update to the user through the appropriate channel, such as printing the update to the console, displaying it on a web page, or speaking it out using text-to-speech capabilities. Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to handle cases where the weather API request fails or the location input is invalid. Use try-catch blocks or error handling functions to gracefully handle exceptions and provide meaningful error messages to the user. Testing and Optimization: Test the weather update feature thoroughly to ensure its accuracy and reliability. Continuously optimize the code based on user feedback and performance metrics, such as response time and error rates. Remember to use appropriate libraries or frameworks for making API requests, handling JSON data, and validating user input based on your programming language of choice. I hope this helps you in writing the code for each block in the weather update feature. Let me know if you have any further questions! Certainly! Integration is a crucial step in implementing the weather update feature in your Genius. Here's an example of how you can integrate with a weather API using Python: In this example, we use the WeatherAPI service to fetch the current weather data for the specified location. The get_weather_data function sends an HTTP GET request to the API endpoint, passing the user's location as a parameter. The API response is then processed using the process_weather_data function to extract relevant information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. Finally, the weather update is generated and provided to the user. Remember to replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual API key from the weather service you are using. Additionally, you may need to install the requests library using pip install requests if it is not already installed. I hope this example helps you understand the integration process for retrieving weather data from a weather API. Let me know if you have any further questions! Certainly! Here's a more detailed explanation of the integration process for the weather update feature: You can use various methods for location validation, such as checking against a list of valid locations, using a geocoding service to verify the location, or implementing a regular expression pattern matching. Choose a weather API service that provides the necessary weather data. Sign up for an API key from the chosen weather service provider. Use the API key to authenticate your requests to the weather API. Make an HTTP request to the weather API endpoint, passing the user's location as a parameter. Handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to the user. Remember to use the appropriate libraries or frameworks for making API requests, handling JSON data, and validating user input based on your programming language of choice. I hope this detailed explanation helps you understand the integration process for the weather update feature. Let me know if you have any further questions! Certainly! Visualization is an essential aspect of understanding and communicating the structure and components of an Genius. With WorkflowSlyAI, you can utilize ASCII drawings and HTML templates to create visual representations of your Genius's workflow and architecture. To visualize your Genius, you can follow these steps: Workflow Visualization: Use ASCII drawings or flowchart diagrams to represent the workflow of your Genius. Identify the different steps or blocks in the workflow and their relationships. Use arrows or lines to indicate the flow of information or control between the steps. Component Visualization: Create visual representations of the various components or modules in your Genius. Use ASCII art or graphical icons to represent each component. Arrange the components in a logical and intuitive manner to depict their relationships and interactions. HTML Template Integration: Convert your ASCII drawings or graphical representations into HTML templates. Use HTML tags and CSS styling to create visually appealing and interactive visualizations. Embed the HTML templates into your Genius's user interface or documentation for easy access and understanding. By visualizing your Genius, you can gain a clearer understanding of its structure, identify potential bottlenecks or areas for improvement, and effectively communicate its functionality to others. I hope this helps you in visualizing your Genius. Let me know if you have any further questions! Certainly! Here's an example of how you can visualize a Web Map Service (WMS) using HTML and CSS: In this example, we use the Leaflet library, a popular JavaScript library for interactive maps, to visualize the WMS layer. The HTML and CSS code provide a container div with the id "map" where the map will be displayed. The JavaScript code creates a new WMS layer using the L.tileLayer.wms method, specifying the URL of the WMS service, the desired layers, image format, and transparency settings. Finally, the WMS layer is added to the map using the addTo method. You can customize the map's size, initial view, and other properties according to your requirements. Additionally, make sure to replace 'https://example.com/wms' with the actual URL of your WMS service and 'layer_name' with the name of the desired layer. I hope this example helps you visualize a WMS layer using HTML and CSS. Let me know if you have any further questions!}] The Genius receives the weather data from the API response. The Genius extracts relevant information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions from the data. Generate Weather Update: The Genius generates a concise and informative weather update based on the extracted information. The update may include the current temperature, weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy), and any additional relevant details. Provide Weather Update: The Genius delivers the weather update to the user through the appropriate channel (e.g., text response, voice response, visual display). End: The virtual Genius concludes the weather update process. Please note that the specific implementation details, including the weather API used and the format of the weather update, may vary based on the chosen weather service and the platform on which the virtual Genius operates. I hope this logical flow helps you in designing the weather update feature for your virtual Genius. Let me know if you need any further assistance! Learn more: Certainly! Let's transform the logical flow of the weather update feature into a workflow representation: In this workflow: The process starts with the "Start" node. The user provides the location information at the "Gather Location Information" node. The Genius retrieves weather data from the API at the "Retrieve Weather Data" node. The weather data is processed at the "Process Weather Data" node. The Genius generates a weather update at the "Generate Weather Update" node. The weather update is provided to the user at the "Provide Weather Update" node. The process ends at the "End" node. Please note that this is a simplified representation of the workflow, and the actual implementation may involve additional steps or decision points based on the specific requirements and capabilities of the virtual Genius. I hope this workflow representation helps you visualize the sequence of actions in the weather update feature.

This document represents the current state of the specification.It includes all features so far releasedas well as all features planned to be added in the next release. You can find all specification releases here.You can find the specification roadmap here. Workflows allow us to capture and organize business requirements in a unified manner.They can bridge the gap between how we express and model business logic. A key component of workflows is the domain-specific language (DSL) we use to model ourbusiness logic and solutions. Selecting the appropriate workflow language for our business and technology domains isa very important decision to be considered. Serverless Workflow focuses on defining a vendor-neutral, platform-independent, and declarative workflowlanguage that targets the serverless computing technology domain.It can be used to significantly bridge the gap between your unique business domain and the target technology domain. The lack of a common way to define and model workflows means that we must constantly re-learnhow to write them. This also limits the potential for common libraries, tooling andinfrastructure to aid workflow modeling and execution across different platforms.Portability as well as productivity that can be achieved from workflow orchestration is hindered overall. Serverless Workflow addresses the need for a community-driven, vendor-neutral and a platform-independentworkflow language specification that targets the serverless computing technology domain. Having and using a specification-based workflow language allows us to model our workflows once and deploy themonto many different container/cloud platforms, expecting the same execution results. For more information on the history, development and design rationale behind the specification, see the Serverless Workflow Wiki. Serverless Workflow language takes advantage of well-established and known standards such as CloudEvents, OpenAPI specifications,gRPC and GraphQL. The specification has multiple components: Definitions of the workflow language. This is defined via the Workflow JSON Schema. You can use bothJSON and YAML formats to model your workflows. Software Development Kits (SDKs) for Go, Java, .NET, Typescript and Python, and we plan to add them for more languages in the future. Set of Workflow Extensions whichallow users to define additional, non-execution-related workflow information. This information can be used to improveworkflow performance.Some example workflow extensions include Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), Rate Limiting, Simulation, Tracing, etc. Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) to be used as a specification conformance tool for runtime implementations. Following sections provide detailed descriptions of all parts of the Serverless Workflow language. This section describes some of the core Serverless Workflow concepts: A workflow definition is a JSON or YAML file that conforms to the Serverless Workflow specification DSL.It consists of the core Workflow Definition Structureand the Workflow Model It defines a blueprint used by runtimes for its execution. A business solution can be composed of any number of related workflow definitions.Their relationships are explicitly modeled with the Serverless Workflow language (for exampleby using SubFlowRef Definition in actions). Runtimes can initialize workflow definitions for some particular set of data inputs or events. A workflow instance represents a single workflow execution corresponding to the instructions provided by aworkflow definition. A workflow instance can be short or long-running. A single workflow instanceshould be isolated, meaning it should not share state and data with other workflow instances.Workflow instances should be able to communicate with each other via events. Depending on their workflow definition, workflow instances can be short-lived orcan execute for days, weeks, or years. Each workflow instances should have its unique identifier, which should remainunchanged throughout its execution. Workflow instances can be started providing some data input. This is described in detail in theworkflow data input section.Workflow instances can also wait for examples to start their execution, which is the casewhere a workflow definition contains a EventState starting workflow state. The workflow definition also explicitly defines when a workflow instance should be completed.By default, instances should be completed once there are no active workflow paths (all activepaths reach a state containing the default end definition),or if the defined workflowExecTimeout time is reached.Other ways, such as using the terminate property of the end definition to terminate instance execution,or defining an workflowExecTimeout property are also possible. For long-running workflow-executions, you can utilize the keepActive workflow property whichprovides more control as to when exactly to terminate workflow execution. In cases where aworkflow execution should be continued as a new one, the DSL also provides the continueAs property which is describedin detail in the Continuing a new Execution section. The Serverless Workflow language is composed of: Function definitions - Reusable functions that can declare services that need to be invoked, or expressions to be evaluated. Event definitions - Reusable declarations of events that need to be consumed to start or continue workflow instances, trigger function/service execution, or be produced during workflow execution. Retry definitions - Reusable retry definitions. Can specify retry strategies for service invocations during workflow execution. Timeout definitions - Reusable timeout definitions. Can specify default workflow execution timeout, as well as workflow state, action, and branch execution timeouts. Errors definition - Reusable error definitions. Provide domain-specific error definitions which can be referenced in workflow states error handling. State definitions - Definition of states, the building blocks of workflow control flow logic. States can reference the reusable function, event and retry definitions. Serverless Workflow data is represented in JSON format.Data flow and execution logic go hand in hand, meaning as workflow execution follows the workflow definitionlogic, so does the workflow data: The initial Workflow data input is passed to the workflow starting state as its data input.When a state finishes its execution, its data output is passed as data input to the next state that should be executed. When workflow execution ends, the last executed workflow state's data output becomes the final Workflow data output. States can filter their data inputs and outputs using State Data filters. States can also consume events as well as invoke services. These event payloads and service invocation resultscan be filtered using Event data filters and Action data filters. Data filters use workflow expressions for selecting and manipulating state datainput and output, action inputs and results, and event payloads. Multiple filters can be combined to gain high level of control of your workflow state data. You can find an example of that inthis section. Data from consumed events,and action execution results are added/mergedto state data. Reference the data merging section to learn about the merging rules that should be applied. The initial data input into a workflow instance. Must be a valid JSON object.If no input is provided, the default data input should be an empty JSON object: { } Workflow data input is passed to the workflow starting state as its data input. States in a workflow can receive data (data input) and produce a data result (data output). The state's data input is typically the previous state's data output.When a state completes its execution, its data output is passed to the state's data input it transitions to.There are two rules to consider here: If the state is the workflow starting state, its data input is the workflow data input. When workflow execution ends, the data output of the last executed state becomes the workflow data output. Each workflow execution should produce a data output.The workflow data output is the data output of the last executed workflow state. Parameter Description Type Required input Workflow expression to filter the states data input string no output Workflow expression that filters the states data output string no Click to view example definition JSON YAML "stateDataFilter": { "input": "${ .orders }", "output": "${ .provisionedOrders }" stateDataFilter: input: "${ .orders }" output: "${ .provisionedOrders }" State data filters can be used to filter the state's data input and output. The state data filters input property expression is applied when the workflow transitions to the current state and receives its data input.It can be used to select only data that is needed and disregard what is not needed.If input is not defined or does not select any parts of the state's data input, its data input is not filtered. The state data filter output property expression is applied right before the state transitions to the next state defined.It filters the state's data output to be passed as data input to the transitioning state.If the current state is the workflow end state, the filtered state's data output becomes the workflow data output.If output is not defined or does not select any parts of the state's data output, its data output is not filtered. Results of the input expression should become the state data input.Results of the output expression should become the state data output. For more information on this you can reference the data merging section. Let's take a look at some examples of state filters. For our examples let's say the data input to our state is as follows: "fruits": [ "apple", "orange", "pear" ], "vegetables": [ "veggieName": "potato", "veggieLike": true "veggieName": "broccoli", "veggieLike": false For the first example, our state only cares about fruits data, and we want to disregard the vegetables. To do thiswe can define a state filter: "stateDataFilter": { "input": "${ {fruits: .fruits} }" The state data output then would include only the fruits data: "fruits": [ "apple", "orange", "pear"] For our second example, let's say that we are interested in the only vegetable "veggie-like".Here we have two ways of filtering our data, depending on if actions within our state need access to all vegetables, oronly the ones that are "veggie-like". The first way would be to use both "input", and "output": "input": "${ {vegetables: .vegetables} }", "output": "${ {vegetables: [.vegetables[] | select(.veggieLike == true)]} }" The states data input filter selects all the vegetables from the main data input. Once all actions have performed, before the state transitionor workflow execution completion (if this is an end state), the "output" of the state filter selects only the vegetables which are "veggie like". The second way would be to directly filter only the "veggie like" vegetables with just the data input path: "input": "${ {vegetables: [.vegetables[] | select(.veggieLike == true)]} }" fromStateData Workflow expression that filters state data that can be used by the action string no useResults If set to false, action data results are not added/merged to state data. In this case 'results' and 'toStateData' should be ignored. Default is true. boolean no results Workflow expression that filters the actions data results string no toStateData Workflow expression that selects a state data element to which the action results should be added/merged into. If not specified denotes the top-level state data element string no "actionDataFilter": { "fromStateData": "${ .language }", "results": "${ .results.greeting }", "toStateData": "${ .finalgreeting }" actionDataFilter: fromStateData: "${ .language }" results: "${ .results.greeting }" toStateData: "${ .finalgreeting }" Action data filters can be used inside Action definitions.Each action can define this filter which can: Filter the state data to select only the data that can be used within function definition arguments using its fromStateData property. Filter the action results to select only the result data that should be added/merged back into the state datausing its results property. Select the part of state data which the action data results should be added/merged tousing the toStateData property. To give an example, let's say we have an action which returns a list of breads and pasta types.For our workflow, we are only interested into breads and not the pasta. Action results: "breads": ["baguette", "brioche", "rye"], "pasta": [ "penne", "spaghetti", "ravioli"] We can use an action data filter to filter only the breads data: "actions":[ "functionRef": "breadAndPastaTypesFunction", "actionDataFilter": { "results": "${ {breads: .breads} }" } ] The results will filter the action results, which would then be: "breads": [ "baguette", "brioche", "rye" Now let's take a look at a similar example (same expected action results) and assume our current state data is: "itemsToBuyAtStore": [ and have the following action definition: "results": "${ [ .breads[0], .pasta[1] ] }", "toStateData": "${ .itemsToBuyAtStore }" In this case, our results select the first bread and the second element of the pasta array.The toStateData expression then selects the itemsToBuyAtStore array of the state data to add/merge these resultsinto. With this, after our action executes the state data would be: "spaghetti" In the case action results should not be added/merged to state data, we can set the useResults property to false.In this case, the results and toStateData properties should be ignored, and nothing is added/merged to state data.If useResults is not specified (or it's value set to true), action results, if available, should be added/merged to state data. useData If set to false, event payload is not added/merged to state data. In this case 'data' and 'toStateData' should be ignored. Default is true. boolean no data Workflow expression that filters the event data (payload) string no "eventDataFilter": { "data": "${ .data.results }" eventDataFilter: data: "${ .data.results }" Event data filters can be used to filter consumed event payloads.They can be used to: Filter the event payload to select only the data that should be added/merged into the state datausing its data property. Select the part of state data into which the event payload should be added/merged intousing the toStateData property. Allows event data to be filtered and added to or merged with the state data. All events have to be in the CloudEvents formatand event data filters can filter both context attributes and the event payload (data) using the data property. Here is an example using an event filter: Note that the data input to the Event data filters depends on the dataOnly property of the associated Event definition.If this property is not defined (has default value of true), Event data filter expressions are evaluated against the event payload (the CloudEvents data attribute only). If it is set tofalse, the expressions should be evaluated against the entire CloudEvent (including its context attributes). In the case event data/payload should not be added/merged to state data, we can set the useData property to false.In this case, the data and toStateData properties should be ignored, and nothing is added/merged to state data.If useData is not specified (or it's value set to true), event payload, if available, should be added/merged to state data. As Event states can take advantage of all defined data filters. In the example below, we definea workflow with a single event state and show how data filters can be combined. "id": "GreetCustomersWorkflow", "name": "Greet Customers when they arrive", "version": "1.0.0", "specVersion": "0.8", "start": "WaitForCustomerToArrive", "states":[ { "name": "WaitForCustomerToArrive", "type": "event", "onEvents": [{ "eventRefs": ["CustomerArrivesEvent"], "eventDataFilter": { "data": "${ .customer }", "toStateData": "${ .customerInfo }" }, "actions":[ { "functionRef": { "refName": "greetingFunction", "arguments": { "greeting": "${ .hello.spanish } ", "customerName": "${ .customerInfo.name } " } }, "actionDataFilter": { "fromStateData": "${ { hello, customerInfo } }", "results": "${ .greetingMessageResult }", "toStateData": "${ .finalCustomerGreeting }" } } ] }], "stateDataFilter": { "input": "${ .greetings } ", "output": "${ { finalCustomerGreeting } }" }, "end": true "events": [{ "name": "CustomerArrivesEvent", "type": "customer-arrival-type", "source": "customer-arrival-event-source" }], "functions": [{ "name": "greetingFunction", "operation": "http://my.api.org/myapi.json#greeting" }] The workflow data input when starting workflow execution is assumed to include greetings in different languages: "greetings": { "hello": { "english": "Hello", "spanish": "Hola", "german": "Hallo", "russian": "" "goodbye": { "english": "Goodbye", "spanish": "Adis", "german": "Auf Wiedersehen", "russian": "" The workflow data input then becomes the data input of the starting workflow state. We also assume for this example that the CloudEvent that our event state consumes include the data (payload): "customer": { "name": "John Michaels", "address": "111 Some Street, SomeCity, SomeCountry", "age": 40 } Here is a sample diagram showing our workflow, each numbered step on this diagram shows a certain defined point duringworkflow execution at which data filters are invoked and correspond to the numbered items below. (1) Workflow execution starts: Workflow data is passed to our "WaitForCustomerToArrive" event state as data input.Workflow executes its starting state, namely the "WaitForCustomerToArrive" event state. The event state stateDataFilter is invoked to filter its data input. The filters "input" expression is evaluated andselects only the "greetings" data. The rest of the state data input should be disregarded. At this point our state data should be: "hello": { "english": "Hello", "spanish": "Hola", "german": "Hallo", "russian": "" "goodbye": { "english": "Goodbye", "spanish": "Adis", "german": "Auf Wiedersehen", "russian": "" (2) CloudEvent of type "customer-arrival-type" is consumed: Once the event is consumed, the "eventDataFilter" is triggered.Its "data" expression selects the "customer" object from the events data. The "toStateData" expressionsays that we should add/merge this selected event data to the state data in its "customerInfo" property. If this propertyexists it should be merged, if it does not exist, one should be created. At this point our state data contains: "hello": { "english": "Hello", "spanish": "Hola", "german": "Hallo", "russian": "" "goodbye": { "english": "Goodbye", "spanish": "Adis", "german": "Auf Wiedersehen", "russian": "" "customerInfo": { "name": "John Michaels", "address": "111 Some Street, SomeCity, SomeCountry", "age": 40 (3) Event state performs its actions:Before the first action is executed, its actionDataFilter is invoked. Its "fromStateData" expression filtersthe current state data to select from its data that should be available to action arguments. In this exampleit selects the "hello" and "customerInfo" properties from the current state data.At this point the action is executed.We assume that for this example "greetingFunction" returns: "execInfo": { "execTime": "10ms", "failures": false "greetingMessageResult": "Hola John Michaels!" After the action is executed, the actionDataFilter "results" expression is evaluated to filter the results returned from the action execution. In this case, we select only the "greetingMessageResult" element from the results. The action filters "toStateData" expression then defines that we want to add/merge this action result tostate data under the "finalCustomerGreeting" element. At this point, our state data contains: }, "finalCustomerGreeting": "Hola John Michaels!" (4) Event State Completes Execution: When our event state finishes its execution, the states "stateDataFilter" "output" filter expression is executedto filter the state data to create the final state data output. Because our event state is also an end state, its data output becomes the final workflow data output. Namely: "finalCustomerGreeting": "Hola John Michaels!" Consumed event data (payload) and action execution results should be merged into the state data.Event and action data filters can be used to give more details about this operation. By default, with no data filters specified, when an event is consumed, its entire data section (payload) should be mergedto the state data. Merging should be applied to the entire state data JSON element. In case of event and action filters, their "toStateData" property can be defined to select a specific elementof the state data with which merging should be done against. If this element does not exist, a new one shouldbe created first. When merging, the state data element and the data (payload)/action result should have the same type, meaningthat you should not merge arrays with objects or objects with arrays etc. When merging elements of type object should be done by inserting all the key-value pairs from both objects intoa single combined object. If both objects contain a value for the same key, the object of the event data/action resultsshould "win". To give an example, let's say we have the following state data: "customer": { "name": "John", "address": "1234 street", "zip": "12345" and we have the following event payload that needs to be merged into the state data: "zip": "54321" After merging the state data should be: "customer": { "name": "John", "address": "1234 street", "zip": "54321" Merging array types should be done by concatenating them into a larger array including unique elements of both arrays.To give an example, merging: "customers": [ "name": "Jane", "address": "4321 street", into state data: "name": "Michael", "address": "6789 street", "zip": "6789" should produce state data: Merging number types should be done by overwriting the data from events data/action results into the merging element of the state data.For example merging action results: "age": 30 "age": 20 would produce state data: Merging string types should be done by overwriting the data from events data/action results into the merging element of the state data. Workflow functions are reusable definitions for service invocations and/or expression evaluation.They can be referenced by their domain-specific names inside workflow states. Reference the following sections to learn more about workflow functions: Using functions for RESTful service invocations Using functions for gRPC service invocation Using functions for GraphQL service invocation Using functions for expression evaluations We can define if functions are invoked sync or async. Referencethe functionRef to learn more on how to do this. Functions can be used to describe services and their operations that need to be invoked duringworkflow execution. They can be referenced by states action definitions to clearlydefine when the service operations should be invoked during workflow execution, as well as the data parameterspassed to them if needed. Note that with Serverless Workflow, we can also define invocation of services which are triggered via an event.To learn more about that, please reference the event definitions section,as well as the actions definitions eventRef property. Because of an overall lack of a common way to describe different services and their operations,many workflow languages typically chose to define custom function definitions.This approach, however, often runs into issues such as lack of portability, limited capabilities, as well asforcing non-workflow-specific information, such as service authentication, to be added inside the workflow language. To avoid these issues, the Serverless Workflow specification mandates that details aboutRESTful services and their operations be described using the OpenAPI Specification.OpenAPI is a language-agnostic standard that describes discovery of RESTful services.This allows Serverless Workflow language to describe RESTful services in a portableway, as well as workflow runtimes to utilize OpenAPI tooling and APIs to invoke service operations. Here is an example function definition for a RESTful service operation. "functions": [ "name": "sendOrderConfirmation", "operation": "file://confirmationapi.json#sendOrderConfirmation" It can, as previously mentioned be referenced during workflow execution when the invocation of this service is desired.For example: "states": [ "name":"SendConfirmState", "type":"operation", "actions":[ { "functionRef": "sendOrderConfirmation" }], "end": true }] Note that the referenced function definition type in this case must be rest (default type). For more information about functions, reference the Functions definitions section. Functions can be used to invoke PUBLISH and SUBSCRIBE operations on a message broker documented by the Async API Specification.Async API operations are bound to a channel which describes the technology, security mechanisms, input and validation to be used for their execution. Let's take a look at a hypothetical Async API document (assumed its stored locally with the file name streetlightsapi.yaml) and define a single publish operation: asyncapi: 2.1.0 info: title: Streetlights API version: 1.0.0 description: | The Smartylighting Streetlights API allows you to remotely manage the city lights. license: name: Apache 2.0 url: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 servers: mosquitto: url: mqtt://test.mosquitto.org protocol: mqtt channels: light/measured: publish: summary: Inform about environmental lighting conditions for a particular streetlight. operationId: onLightMeasured message: name: LightMeasured payload: type: object properties: id: type: integer minimum: 0 description: Id of the streetlight. lumens: description: Light intensity measured in lumens. sentAt: type: string format: date-time description: Date and time when the message was sent. To define a workflow action invocation, we can then use the following workflow Function Definition and set the operation to onLightMeasured: "functions": [ "name": "publishLightMeasurements", "operation": "file://streetlightsapi.yaml#onLightMeasured", "type": "asyncapi" Note that the Function Definition's operation property must have the following format: <URI_to_asyncapi_file>#<OperationId> Also note that the referenced function definition type in this case must have the value asyncapi. Our defined function definition can then we referenced in a workflow action, for example: "name": "Publish Measurements", "type": "operation", "actions":[ "name": "Publish Light Measurements", "functionRef":{ "refName": "publishLightMeasurements", "arguments":{ "id": "${ .currentLight.id }", "lumens": "${ .currentLight.lumens }", "sentAt": "${ now }" Similar to defining invocations of operations on RESTful services, you can also use the workflowfunctions definitions that follow the remote procedure call (RPC) protocol.For RPC invocations, the Serverless Workflow specification mandates that they are described using gRPC,a widely used RPC system.gRPC uses Protocol Buffers to define messages, services,and the methods on those services that can be invoked. Let's look at an example of invoking a service method using RPC. For this example let's say we have the followinggRPC protocol buffer definition in a myuserservice.proto file: service UserService { rpc AddUser(User) returns (google.protobuf.Empty) { option (google.api.http) = { post: "/api/v1/users" body: "*" }; rpc ListUsers(ListUsersRequest) returns (stream User) { get: "/api/v1/users" rpc ListUsersByRole(UserRole) returns (stream User) { get: "/api/v1/users/role" rpc UpdateUser(UpdateUserRequest) returns (User) { patch: "/api/v1/users/{user.id}" In our workflow definition, we can then use function definitions: "name": "listUsers", "operation": "file://myuserservice.proto#UserService#ListUsers", "type": "rpc" Note that the operation property has the following format: <URI_to_proto_file>#<Service_Name>#<Service_Method_Name> Note that the referenced function definition type in this case must be rpc. If you want to use GraphQL services, you can also invoke them using a similar syntax to the above methods. We'll use the following GraphQL schema definition to show how that would work with both a query and a mutation: type Query { pets: [Pet] pet(id: Int!): Pet type Mutation { createPet(pet: PetInput!): Pet type Treat { id: Int! type Pet { name: String! favoriteTreat: Treat input PetInput { favoriteTreatId: Int INVOKING A GRAPHQL QUERY In our workflow definition, we can then use a function definition for the pet query field as such: "name": "getOnePet", "operation": "https://example.com/pets/graphql#query#pet", "type": "graphql" Note that the operation property has the following format for the graphql type: <url_to_graphql_endpoint>#<literal "mutation" or "query">#<mutation_or_query_field> In order to invoke this query, we would use the following functionRef parameters: "refName": "getOnePet", "arguments": { "id": 42 "selectionSet": "{ id, name, favoriteTreat { id } }" Which would return the following result: "pet": { "id": 42, "name": "Snuffles", "favoriteTreat": { "id": 9001 INVOKING A GRAPHQL MUTATION Likewise, we would use the following function definition: "name": "createPet", "operation": "https://example.com/pets/graphql#mutation#createPet", With the parameters for the functionRef: "refName": "createPet", "pet": { "id": 43, "name":"Sadaharu", "favoriteTreatId": 9001 Which would execute the mutation, creating the object and returning the following data: "id": 43, "name": "Sadaharu", Note you can include expressions in both arguments and selectionSet: "id": "${ .petId }" "selectionSet": "{ id, name, age(useDogYears: ${ .isPetADog }) { dateOfBirth, years } }" Expressions must be evaluated before executing the operation. Note that GraphQL Subscriptions are not supported at this time. Similar to defining invocations of operations on GraphQL services, you can also use workflowFunctions Definitions to execute complex queries on an OData service. CREATING AN ODATA FUNCTION DEFINITION We start off by creating a workflow Functions Definitions. For example: "name": "queryPersons", "operation": "https://services.odata.org/V3/OData/OData.svc#Persons", "type": "odata" Note that the operation property must follow the following format: <URI_to_odata_service>#<Entity_Set_Name> INVOKING AN ODATA FUNCTION DEFINITION In order to invoke the defined OData function,simply reference it in a workflow Action Definition and set its function arguments. For example: "refName": "queryPersons", "queryOptions":{ "expand": "PersonDetail/Person", "select": "Id, PersonDetail/Person/Name", "top": 5, "orderby": "PersonDetail/Person/Name" In order to ensure compatibility of OData support across runtimes,thearguments property of an OData function referenceshould follow the Serverless Workflow OData Json schema In addition to defining RESTful, AsyncAPI, RPC, GraphQL and OData services and their operations, workflow functions definitionscan also be used to define expressions that should be evaluated during workflow execution. Defining expressions as part of function definitions has the benefit of being able to referencethem by their logical name through workflow states where expression evaluation is required. Expression functions must declare their type parameter to be expression. Let's take a look at an example of such definitions: "name": "isAdult", "operation": ".applicant | .age >= 18", "type": "expression" "name": "isMinor", "operation": ".applicant | .age < 18", Here we define two reusable expression functions. Expressions in Serverless Workflowcan be evaluated against the workflow, or workflow state data. Note that different data filters play a big role as to which parts of theworkflow data are being evaluated by the expressions. Reference theState Data Filters section for more information on this. Our expression function definitions can now be referenced by workflow states when they need to be evaluated. For example: "states":[ "name":"CheckApplicant", "type":"switch", "dataConditions": [ { "name": "Applicant is adult", "condition": "${ fn:isAdult }", "transition": "ApproveApplication" }, "name": "Applicant is minor", "condition": "${ fn:isMinor }", "transition": "RejectApplication" "defaultCondition": { "transition": "RejectApplication" Our expression functions can also be referenced and executed as part of state action execution.Let's say we have the following workflow definition: "name": "simpleadd", "functions": [ "name": "Increment Count Function", "type": "expression", "operation": ".count += 1 | .count" "start": "Initialize Count", "states": [ "name": "Initialize Count", "type": "inject", "data": { "count": 0 "transition": "Increment Count" "name": "Increment Count", "type": "operation", "actions": [ { "functionRef": "Increment Count Function", "actionDataFilter": { "toStateData": "${ .count }" } ], The starting inject state "Initialize Count" injects the count element into our state data,which then becomes the state data input of our "Increment Count" operation state.This state defines an invocation of the "Increment Count Function" expression function defined in our workflow definition. This triggers the evaluation of the defined expression. The input of this expression is by default the current state data.Just like with "rest", and "rpc" type functions, expression functions also produce a result. In this casethe result of the expression is just the number 1.The actions filter then assigns this result to the state data element "count" and the state data becomes: "count": 1 Note that the used function definition type in this case must be expression. For more information about workflow expressions, reference the Workflow Expressions section. Function definitions type property defines a list of function types that are set bythe specification. Some runtime implementations might support additional function types that extend the onesdefined in the specification. In those cases you can define a custom function type with for example: "operation": "/path/to/my/script/order.ts#myFunction", "type": "custom" In this example we define a custom function type that is meant to execute an external TypeScript script. When a custom function type is specified, the operation property value has a custom format, meaning thatits format is controlled by the runtime which provides the custom function type. Later, the function should be able to be used in an action as any other function supported by the specification: [{ "states": [{ "name": "handleOrder", "type": "operation", "actions": [ "name": "sendOrderConfirmation", "functionRef": { "refName": "sendOrderConfirmation", "arguments": { "order": "${ .order }" } } "transition": "emailCustomer" }] Note that custom function types are not portable across runtimes. Workflow model parameters can use expressions to select/manipulate workflow and/or state data. Note that different data filters play a big role as to which parts of the states data are to be used when the expression isevaluated. Reference theState Data Filtering section for more information about state data filters. By default, all workflow expressions should be defined using the jq version 1.6 syntax.You can find more information on jq in its manual. Serverless Workflow does not mandate the use of jq and it's possible to use an expression languageof your choice with the restriction that a single one must be used for all expressionsin a workflow definition. If a different expression language needs to be used, make sure to set the workflowexpressionLang property to identify it to runtime implementations. Note that using a non-default expression language could lower the portability of your workflow definitionsacross multiple container/cloud platforms. All workflow expressions in this document, specification examples as well as comparisons examplesare written using the default jq syntax. Workflow expressions have the following format: ${ expression } Where expression can be either an in-line expression, or a reference to adefined expression function definition. To reference a defined expression function definitionthe expression must have the following format, for example: ${ fn:myExprFuncName } Where fn is the namespace of the defined expression functions andmyExprName is the unique expression function name. To show some expression examples, let's say we have the following state data: "applicant": { "name": "John Doe", "age" : 26, "email": "johndoe@something.com", "address" : { "streetAddress": "Naist street", "city" : "Nara", "postalCode" : "630-0192" "phoneNumbers": [ "type" : "iPhone", "number": "0123-4567-8888" "type" : "home", "number": "0123-4567-8910" In our workflow model we can define our reusable expression function: "name": "IsAdultApplicant", "operation": ".applicant | .age > 18", We will get back to this function definition in just a bit, but now let's take a look at usingan inline expression that sets an input parameter inside an action for example: "actions": [ "functionRef": { "refName": "confirmApplicant", "applicantName": "${ .applicant.name }" In this case our input parameter applicantName would be set to "John Doe". Expressions can also be used to select and manipulate state data, this is in particularly useful forstate data filters. For example let's use another inline expression: "stateDataFilter": { "output": "${ .applicant | {applicant: .name, contactInfo: { email: .email, phone: .phoneNumbers }} }" This would set the data output of the particular state to: "applicant": "John Doe", "contactInfo": { "phone": [ "type": "iPhone", "type": "home", Switch state conditions require for expressions to be resolved to a boolean value (true/false). We can now get back to our previously defined "IsAdultApplicant" expression function and reference it: "dataConditions": [ { "condition": "${ fn:IsAdultApplicant }", "transition": "StartApplication" As previously mentioned, expressions are evaluated against certain subsets of data. For examplethe parameters param of the functionRef definition can evaluate expressionsonly against the data that is available to the action it belongs to.One thing to note here are the top-level workflow definition parameters. Expressions definedin them can only be evaluated against the initial workflow data input. For example let's say that we have a workflow data input of: "inputVersion" : "1.0.0" we can use this expression in the workflow "version" parameter: "id": "MySampleWorkflow", "name": "Sample Workflow", "version": "${ .inputVersion }", "specVersion": "0.8" which would set the workflow version to "1.0.0".Note that the workflow "id" property value is not allowed to use an expression. The workflowdefinition "id" must be a constant value. id Workflow unique identifier string yes (if key is not defined) key Domain-specific workflow identifier string yes (if id is not defined) name Workflow name string no description Workflow description string no version Workflow version. MUST respect the semantic versioning format string no annotations List of helpful terms describing the workflows intended purpose, subject areas, or other important qualities array no dataInputSchema Used to validate the workflow data input against a defined JSON Schema string or object no dataOutputSchema Used to validate the workflow data output against a defined JSON Schema string or object no constants Workflow constants string or object no secrets Workflow secrets string or array no start Workflow start definition string or object no specVersion Serverless Workflow specification release version string yes expressionLang Identifies the expression language used for workflow expressions. Default value is "jq" string no timeouts Defines the workflow default timeout settings string or object no errors Defines checked errors that can be explicitly handled during workflow execution string or array no keepActive If true, workflow instances is not terminated when there are no active execution paths. Instance can be terminated with "terminate end definition" or reaching defined "workflowExecTimeout" boolean no auth Workflow authentication definitions array or string no events Workflow event definitions. array or string no functions Workflow function definitions. Can be either inline function definitions (if array) or URI pointing to a resource containing json/yaml function definitions (if string) array or string no autoRetries If set to true, actions should automatically be retried on unchecked errors. Default is false boolean no retries Workflow retries definitions. Can be either inline retries definitions (if array) or URI pointing to a resource containing json/yaml retry definitions (if string) array or string no states Workflow states array yes extensions Workflow extensions definitions array or string no metadata Metadata information object no "id": "sampleWorkflow", "version": "1.0.0", "specVersion": "0.8", "description": "Sample Workflow", "start": "MyStartingState", "states": [], "functions": [], "events": [], "errors": [], "retries":[] id: sampleWorkflow version: '1.0.0' specVersion: '0.8' name: Sample Workflow description: Sample Workflow start: MyStartingState states: [] functions: [] events: [] errors: [] retries: [] Defines the top-level structure of a serverless workflow model.Following figure describes the main workflow definition blocks. The id property defines the unique, domain-specific workflow identifier, for example "orders", "payment", etc. The key property defines the unique, domain-specific workflow identifier.It can be used when the id property is auto-generated by a content-management system for example.In these cases, you can specify the key property to be the domain-specific identifier of the workflow definition.The id and key properties are mutually exclusive, meaning you cannot define both. The name property is the workflow logical name. The description property can be used to give further information about the workflow. The version property can be used to provide a specific workflow version. It must use the semantic versioning format. The annotations property defines a list of helpful terms describing the workflows intended purpose, subject areas, or other important qualities,for example "machine learning", "monitoring", "networking", etc The dataInputSchema and dataOutputSchema properties can be used to validate input and output data against a defined JSON Schema. The dataInputSchema property validates the workflow data input. Validation should be performed before any states are executed. In case ofa start Event state the input schema is ignored, if present. The failOnValidationErrors property determines if workflow execution should continue in case of validation errors. The dataOutputSchema property validates the Workflow data output. Validation is performed on the output of the workflow execution.The failOnValidationErrors property determines what should be done when the workflow output does not match the provided schema.If failOnValidationErrors is true, an error should be thrown. If executed within a subprocess, that error can be be handled by the parent workflow.If failOnValidationErrors is false, the error should not be propagated. It is up to the implementor to warn the user about that fact. For example, printing a log. Both properties can be expressed as object or string type. If using object type, their schema property might be an URI, which points to the JSON schema used to validate the workflow data input, or it might be the JSON schema object. failOnValidationErrors is optional, default value is true. Example for Json schema reference "dataInputSchema": { "schema": "URI to json schema", "failOnValidationErrors": false Example for Json schema included in the workflow file "dataOutputSchema": { "schema": { "title": "MyJSONSchema", "properties":{ "firstName":{ "type": "string" }, "lastName":{ "failOnValidationErrors": true If using string type, then the string value is the external schema URI and failOnValidationErrors default value of true is assumed. Example using string type "dataInputSchema": "URI_to_json_schema" The secrets property allows you to use sensitive information such as passwords, OAuth tokens, ssh keys, etc. inside yourWorkflow expressions. It has two possible types, string or array.If string type, it is an URI pointing to a JSON or YAML documentwhich contains an array of names of the secrets, for example: "secrets": "file://workflowsecrets.json" If array type, it defines an array (of string types) which contains the names of the secrets, for example: "secrets": ["MY_PASSWORD", "MY_STORAGE_KEY", "MY_ACCOUNT"] For more information about Workflow secrets, reference the Workflow Secrets section. The constants property can be used to define Workflow constants valueswhich are accessible in Workflow Expressions. It has two possible types, string or object.If string type, it is an URI pointing to a JSON or YAML documentwhich contains an object of global definitions, for example: "constants": "file://workflowconstants.json" If object type, it defines a JSON object which contains the constants definitions, for example: "AGE": { "MIN_ADULT": 18 For more information see the Workflow Constants section. The start property defines the workflow starting information. For more information see the start definition section.This property is not required. If not defined, the workflow starting state has to bethe very first state defined in the workflow states array. The specVersion property is used to set the Serverless Workflow specification release versionthe workflow markup adheres to.It has to follow the specification release versions (excluding the leading "v"), meaning that forthe release version v0.8its value should be set to "0.8". The expressionLang property can be used to identify the expression language used for all expressions inthe workflow definition. The default value of this property is "jq".You should set this property if you chose to define workflow expressionswith an expression language / syntax other than the default. The timeouts property is used to define the default workflow timeouts for workflow, state, action, and branchexecution. For more information about timeouts and its use cases see the Workflow Timeouts section. The error property is used to define checked errors that can be explicitly handled during workflow execution.For more information about workflow error handling see this section. The auth property can be either an inline auth definition array, or a URI reference toa resource containing an array of auth definitions.If defined in a separate resource file (Json or Yaml), auth definitions can be re-used by multiple workflow definitions.Auth definitions can be used to define authentication that should be used to accessthe resource defined in the operation property of the function definitions.If we have the following function definition: "functions": [ "name": "HelloWorldFunction", "operation": "https://secure.resources.com/myapi.json#helloWorld", "authRef": "My Basic Auth" The authRef property is used to reference an authentication definition inthe auth property and should be applied when invoking the helloWorld function. An AuthRef object can alternatively be used to configure the authentication definition to use when accessing the function's resource and/or when invoking the function. The functions property can be either an in-line function definition array, or an URI reference toa resource containing an array of functions definition.Referenced resource can be used by multiple workflow definitions. Here is an example of using external resource for function definitions: Workflow definition: "functions": "http://myhost:8080/functiondefs.json", "states":[ ... Function definitions resource: "name":"HelloWorldFunction", "operation":"file://myapi.json#helloWorld" Referenced resource must conform to the specifications Workflow Functions JSON Schema. The events property can be either an in-line event definition array, or an URI reference toa resource containing an array of event definition. Referenced resource can be used by multiple workflow definitions. Here is an example of using external resource for event definitions: "events": "http://myhost:8080/eventsdefs.json", Event definitions resource: "events": [ "name": "ApplicantInfo", "type": "org.application.info", "source": "applicationssource", "correlation": [ { "contextAttributeName": "applicantId" ] Referenced resource must conform to the specifications Workflow Events JSON Schema. The retries property can be either an in-line retry definition array, or an URI reference toa resource containing an array of retry definition.Referenced resource can be used by multiple workflow definitions. For more information aboutusing and referencing retry definitions see the Workflow Error Handling section. The keepActive property allows you to change the default behavior of workflow instances.By default, as described in the Core Concepts section, a workflow instance is terminated once there are no moreactive execution paths, one of its active paths ends in a "terminate" end definition, or whenits workflowExecTimeout time is reached. Setting the keepActive property to true allows you to change this default behavior in that a workflow instancecreated from this workflow definition can only be terminated if one of its active paths ends in a "terminate" end definition, or whenits workflowExecTimeout time is reached.This allows you to explicitly model workflows where an instance should be kept alive, to collect (event) data for example. You can reference the specification examples to see the keepActive property in action. The extensions property can be used to define extensions for this workflow definition.You can learn more about workflow extensions in the Extensions section.Sample extensions property definition could look like this for example: "extensions": [ "extensionId": "workflow-ratelimiting-extension", "path": "file://myextensions/ratelimiting.yml" "extensionId": "workflow-kpi-extension", "path": "file://myextensions/kpi.yml" Here we define two workflow extensions, namely the rate limiting and kpi extensions for our workflow definition. Workflow states define building blocks of the workflow execution instructions. They define thecontrol flow logic instructions on what the workflow is supposed to do.Serverless Workflow defines the following Workflow States: Name Description Consumes events? Produces events? Executes actions? Handles errors/retries? Allows parallel execution? Makes data-based transitions? Can be workflow start state? Can be workflow end state? Event Define events that trigger action execution yes yes yes yes yes no yes yes Operation Execute one or more actions no yes yes yes yes no yes yes Switch Define data-based or event-based workflow transitions no yes no yes no yes yes no Sleep Sleep workflow execution for a specific time duration no yes no yes no no yes yes Parallel Causes parallel execution of branches (set of states) no yes no yes yes no yes yes Inject Inject static data into state data no yes no yes no no yes yes ForEach Parallel execution of states for each element of a data array no yes no yes yes no yes yes Callback Manual decision step. Executes a function and waits for callback event that indicates completion of the manual decision yes yes yes yes no no yes yes EVENT STATE name Unique State name string yes type State type string yes exclusive If true, consuming one of the defined events causes its associated actions to be performed. If false, all of the defined events must be consumed in order for actions to be performed. Default is true boolean no onEvents Define the events to be consumed and optional actions to be performed array yes timeouts State specific timeout settings object no stateDataFilter State data filter definition object no transition Next transition of the workflow after all the actions have been performed string or object yes (if end is not defined) onErrors States error handling definitions array no end Is this state an end state boolean or object yes (if transition is not defined) compensatedBy Unique name of a workflow state which is responsible for compensation of this state string no "name": "MonitorVitals", "type": "event", "exclusive": true, "onEvents": [{ "eventRefs": ["HighBodyTemperature"], "actions": [{ "functionRef": { "refName": "sendTylenolOrder", "arguments": { "patientid": "${ .patientId }" }] "eventRefs": ["HighBloodPressure"], "refName": "callNurse", "eventRefs": ["HighRespirationRate"], "refName": "callPulmonologist", "end": { "terminate": true name: MonitorVitals type: event exclusive: true onEvents: - eventRefs: - HighBodyTemperature actions: - functionRef: refName: sendTylenolOrder arguments: patientid: "${ .patientId }" - HighBloodPressure refName: callNurse - HighRespirationRate refName: callPulmonologist end: terminate: true Event states await one or more events and perform actions when they are received.If defined as the workflow starting state, the event state definition controls when the workflowinstances should be created. The exclusive property determines if the state should wait for any of the defined events in the onEvents array, orif all defined events must be present for their associated actions to be performed. Following two figures illustrate the exclusive property: If the Event state in this case is a workflow starting state, the occurrence of any of the defined events would start a new workflow instance. If the Event state in this case is a workflow starting state, the occurrence of all defined events would start a newworkflow instance. In order to consider only events that are related to each other, we need to set the correlation property in the workflowevents definitions. This allows us to set up event correlation rules against the eventsextension context attributes. If the Event state is not a workflow starting state, the timeout property can be used to define the time duration from theinvocation of the event state. If the defined event, or events have not been received during this time,the state should transition to the next state or can end the workflow execution (if it is an end state). The timeouts property can be used to define state specific timeout settings. Event states can define thestateExecTimeout, actionExecTimeout, and eventTimeout properties.For more information about Event state specific event timeout settings reference this section.For more information about workflow timeouts reference the Workflow Timeouts section. Note that transition and end properties are mutually exclusive, meaning that you cannot define both of them at the same time. OPERATION STATE actionMode Should actions be performed sequentially or in parallel. Default is sequential enum no actions Actions to be performed array yes stateDataFilter State data filter object no onErrors States error handling and retries definitions array no usedForCompensation If true, this state is used to compensate another state. Default is false boolean no "name": "RejectApplication", "type": "operation", "actionMode": "sequential", "actions": [ "refName": "sendRejectionEmailFunction", "customer": "${ .customer }" "end": true name: RejectApplication type: operation actionMode: sequential actions: - functionRef: refName: sendRejectionEmailFunction arguments: customer: "${ .customer }" end: true Operation state defines a set of actions to be performed in sequence or in parallel.Once all actions have been performed, a transition to another state can occur. The timeouts property can be used to define state specific timeout settings. Operation states can definethe stateExecTimeout and actionExecTimeout settings. For more information on Workflow timeouts referencethe Workflow Timeouts section. SWITCH STATE dataConditions Defined if the Switch state evaluates conditions and transitions based on state data. array yes (if eventConditions is not defined) eventConditions Defined if the Switch state evaluates conditions and transitions based on arrival of events. array yes (if dataConditions is not defined defaultCondition Default transition of the workflow if there is no matching data conditions or event timeout is reached. Can be a transition or end definition object yes "name":"CheckVisaStatus", "eventConditions": [ "eventRef": "visaApprovedEvent", "transition": "HandleApprovedVisa" "eventRef": "visaRejectedEvent", "transition": "HandleRejectedVisa" "timeouts": { "eventTimeout": "PT1H" "transition": "HandleNoVisaDecision" name: CheckVisaStatus type: switch eventConditions: - eventRef: visaApprovedEvent transition: HandleApprovedVisa - eventRef: visaRejectedEvent transition: HandleRejectedVisa timeouts: eventTimeout: PT1H defaultCondition: transition: HandleNoVisaDecision Switch states can be viewed as workflow gateways: they can direct transitions of a workflow based on certain conditions.There are two types of conditions for switch states: Data-based conditions Event-based conditions These are exclusive, meaning that a switch state can define one or the other condition type, but not both. At times multiple defined conditions can be evaluated to true by runtime implementations.Conditions defined first take precedence over conditions defined later. This is backed by the fact that arrays/sequencesare ordered in both JSON and YAML. For example, let's say there are two true conditions: A and B, defined in that order.Because A was defined first, its transition will be executed, not B's. In case of data-based conditions definition, switch state controls workflow transitions based on the states data.If no defined conditions can be matched, the state transitions is taken based on the defaultCondition property.This property can be either a transition to another workflow state, or an end definition meaning a workflow end. For event-based conditions, a switch state acts as a workflow wait state. It halts workflow executionuntil one of the referenced events arrive, then making a transition depending on that event definition.If events defined in event-based conditions do not arrive before the states eventTimeout property expires,state transitions are based on the defined defaultCondition property. The timeouts property can be used to define state specific timeout settings. Switch states can define thestateExecTimeout setting. If eventConditions is defined, the switch state can also define theeventTimeout property. For more information on workflow timeouts reference the Workflow Timeouts section. SLEEP STATE duration Duration (ISO 8601 duration format) to sleep. For example: "PT15M" (sleep 15 minutes), or "P2DT3H4M" (sleep 2 days, 3 hours and 4 minutes) string yes transition Next transition of the workflow after the sleep string or object yes (if end is not defined) "name": "SleepFiveSeconds", "type": "sleep", "duration": "PT5S", "transition": "GetJobStatus" name: SleepFiveSeconds type: sleep duration: PT5S transition: GetJobStatus Sleep statesuspends workflow execution for a given time duration. The delay is defined in its duration property using the ISO 8601duration format. PARALLEL STATE branches List of branches for this parallel state array yes completionType Option types on how to complete branch execution. Default is "allOf" enum no numCompleted Used when branchCompletionType is set to atLeast to specify the least number of branches that must complete in order for the state to transition/end. string or number yes (if completionType is atLeast) transition Next transition of the workflow after all branches have completed execution string or object yes (if end is not defined) { "name":"ParallelExec", "type":"parallel", "completionType": "allOf", "branches": [ "name": "Branch1", "actions": [ { "functionRef": { "refName": "functionNameOne", "arguments": { "order": "${ .someParam }" "name": "Branch2", { "functionRef": { "refName": "functionNameTwo", "arguments": { "order": "${ .someParam }" } } } ] "end": true name: ParallelExec type: parallel completionType: allOf branches: - name: Branch1 refName: functionNameOne order: "${ .someParam }" - name: Branch2 refName: functionNameTwo Parallel state defines a collection of branches that are executed in parallel.A parallel state can be seen a state which splits up the current workflow instance execution pathinto multiple ones, one for each branch. These execution paths are performed in paralleland are joined back into the current execution path depending on the defined completionType parameter value. The "completionType" enum specifies the different ways of completing branch execution: allOf: All branches must complete execution before the state can transition/end. This is the default value in case this parameter is not defined in the parallel state definition. atLeast: State can transition/end once at least the specified number of branches have completed execution. In this case you must alsospecify the numCompleted property to define this number. Exceptions may occur during execution of branches of the Parallel state, this is described in detail in this section. The timeouts property can be used to set state specific timeout settings. Parallel states can define thestateExecTimeout and branchExecTimeout timeout settings. For more information on workflow timeoutsreference the Workflow Timeouts section. INJECT STATE data JSON object which can be set as state's data input and can be manipulated via filter object yes transition Next transition of the workflow after injection has completed string or object yes (if end is not defined) "name":"Hello", "type":"inject", "data": { "result": "Hello" "transition": "World" name: Hello type: inject data: result: Hello transition: World Inject state can be used to inject static data into state data input. Inject state does not perform any actions.It is very useful for debugging, for example, as you can test/simulate workflow execution with pre-set data that would typicallybe dynamic in nature (e.g., function calls, events). The inject state data property allows you to statically define a JSON object which gets added to the states data input.You can use the filter property to control the states data output to the transition state. Here is a typical example of how to use the inject state to add static data into its states data input, which then is passedas data output to the transition state: "name":"SimpleInjectState", "type":"inject", "data": { "person": { "fname": "John", "lname": "Doe", "address": "1234 SomeStreet", "age": 40 }, "transition": "GreetPersonState" name: SimpleInjectState type: inject data: person: fname: John lname: Doe address: 1234 SomeStreet age: 40 transition: GreetPersonState The data output of the "SimpleInjectState" which then is passed as input to the transition state would be: "person": { If the inject state already receives a data input from the previous transition state, the inject data should be mergedwith its data input. You can also use the filter property to filter the state data after data is injected. Let's say we have: "name":"SimpleInjectState", "people": [ "fname": "John", "lname": "Doe", "address": "1234 SomeStreet", "age": 40 }, "fname": "Marry", "lname": "Allice", "age": 25 "fname": "Kelly", "lname": "Mill", "age": 30 "stateDataFilter": { "output": "${ {people: [.people[] | select(.age < 40)]} }" "transition": "GreetPersonState" people: - fname: John - fname: Marry lname: Allice age: 25 - fname: Kelly lname: Mill age: 30 stateDataFilter: output: "${ {people: [.people[] | select(.age < 40)]} }" In which case the states data output would include only people whose age is less than 40: "people": [ "fname": "Marry", "lname": "Allice", "age": 25 "fname": "Kelly", "lname": "Mill", "age": 30 You can change your output path easily during testing, for example change the expression to: ${ {people: [.people[] | select(.age >= 40)]} } This allows you to test if your workflow behaves properly for cases when there are people whose age is greater or equal 40. FOREACH STATE inputCollection Workflow expression selecting an array element of the states data string yes outputCollection Workflow expression specifying an array element of the states data to add the results of each iteration string no iterationParam Name of the iteration parameter that can be referenced in actions/workflow. For each parallel iteration, this param should contain an unique element of the inputCollection array string no batchSize Specifies how many iterations may run in parallel at the same time. Used if mode property is set to parallel (default). If not specified, its value should be the size of the inputCollection string or number no mode Specifies how iterations are to be performed (sequentially or in parallel). Default is parallel enum no actions Actions to be executed for each of the elements of inputCollection array yes transition Next transition of the workflow after state has completed string or object yes (if end is not defined) "name": "ProvisionOrdersState", "type": "foreach", "inputCollection": "${ .orders }", "iterationParam": "singleorder", "outputCollection": "${ .provisionresults }", "refName": "provisionOrderFunction", "order": "${ $singleorder }" name: ProvisionOrdersState type: foreach inputCollection: "${ .orders }" iterationParam: "singleorder" outputCollection: "${ .provisionresults }" refName: provisionOrderFunction order: "${ $singleorder }" ForEach states can be used to execute actions for each element of a data set. Each iteration of the ForEach state is by default executed in parallel by default.However, executing iterations sequentially is also possible by setting the value of the mode property tosequential. The mode property defines if iterations should be done sequentially or in parallel. By default,if mode is not specified, iterations should be done in parallel. If the default parallel iteration mode is used, the batchSize property to the number of iterations (batch)that can be executed at a time. To give an example, if the number of iterations is 55 and batchSizeis set to 10, 10 iterations are to be executed at a time, meaning that the state would execute 10 iterations in parallel,then execute the next batch of 10 iterations. After 5 such executions, the remaining 5 iterations are to be executed in the last batch.The batch size value must be greater than 1. If not specified, its value should be the size of the inputCollection (all iterations). The inputCollection property is a workflow expression which selects an array in the states data. All iterationsare performed against data elements of this array. If this array does not exist, the runtime should throwan error. This error can be handled inside the states onErrors definition. The outputCollection property is a workflow expression which selects an array in the state data where the resultsof each iteration should be added to. If this array does not exist, it should be created. The iterationParam property defines the name of the iteration parameter passed to each iteration of the ForEach state.It should contain the unique element of the inputCollection array and made available to actions of the ForEach state.iterationParam can be accessed as an expression variable. In JQ, expression variables are prefixed by $.If iterationParam is not explicitly defined, runtimes should create one and populate it with the value of the uniqueiteration parameter for each iteration of the ForEach state. The actions property defines actions to be executed in each state iteration. Let's take a look at an example: In this example the data input to our workflow is an array of orders: "orders": [ "orderNumber": "1234", "completed": true, "email": "firstBuyer@buyer.com" "orderNumber": "5678", "email": "secondBuyer@buyer.com" "orderNumber": "9910", "completed": false, "email": "thirdBuyer@buyer.com" and our workflow is defined as: "id": "sendConfirmWorkflow", "name": "SendConfirmationForCompletedOrders", "version": "1.0.0", "specVersion": "0.8", "start": "SendConfirmState", "name": "sendConfirmationFunction", "states": [ "type":"foreach", "inputCollection": "${ [.orders[] | select(.completed == true)] }", "iterationParam": "completedorder", "outputCollection": "${ .confirmationresults }", "functionRef": { "refName": "sendConfirmationFunction", "arguments": { "orderNumber": "${ $completedorder.orderNumber }", "email": "${ $completedorder.email }" } id: sendConfirmWorkflow name: SendConfirmationForCompletedOrders start: SendConfirmState functions: - name: sendConfirmationFunction operation: file://confirmationapi.json#sendOrderConfirmation states: - name: SendConfirmState type: foreach inputCollection: "${ [.orders[] | select(.completed == true)] }" iterationParam: completedorder outputCollection: "${ .confirmationresults }" refName: sendConfirmationFunction orderNumber: "${ $completedorder.orderNumber }" email: "${ $completedorder.email }" end: true The workflow data input containing order information is passed to the SendConfirmState ForEach state.The ForEach state defines an inputCollection property which selects all orders that have the completed property set to true. For each element of the array selected by inputCollection a JSON object defined by iterationParam should becreated containing an unique element of inputCollection and passed as the data input to the parallel executed actions. So for this example, we would have two parallel executions of the sendConfirmationFunction, the first one having data: "completedorder": { "orderNumber": "1234", "completed": true, "email": "firstBuyer@buyer.com" and the second: "orderNumber": "5678", "email": "secondBuyer@buyer.com" The results of each parallel action execution are stored as elements in the state data array defined by the outputCollection property. The timeouts property can be used to set state specific timeout settings. ForEach states can define thestateExecTimeout and actionExecTimeout settings. For more information on workflow timeouts reference the Workflow Timeoutssection. CALLBACK STATE action Defines the action to be executed object yes eventRef References an unique callback event name in the defined workflow events string yes eventDataFilter Callback event data filter definition object no transition Next transition of the workflow after callback event has been received string or object yes (if end is not defined) compensatedBy Uniaue name of a workflow state which is responsible for compensation of this state string no "name": "CheckCredit", "type": "callback", "action": { "refName": "callCreditCheckMicroservice", "eventRef": "CreditCheckCompletedEvent", "timeouts": { "stateExecTimeout": "PT15M" "transition": "EvaluateDecision" name: CheckCredit type: callback action: functionRef: refName: callCreditCheckMicroservice eventRef: CreditCheckCompletedEvent stateExecTimeout: PT15M transition: EvaluateDecision Serverless orchestration can at times require manual steps/decisions to be made. While some work performedin a serverless workflow can be executed automatically, some decisions must involve manual steps (e.g., human decisions).The Callback state allows you to explicitly model manual decision steps during workflow execution. The action property defines a function call that triggers an external activity/service. Once the action executes,the callback state will wait for a CloudEvent (defined via the eventRef property), which indicates the completionof the manual decision by the called service. Note that the called decision service is responsible for emitting the callback CloudEvent indicating the completion of thedecision and including the decision results as part of the event payload. This event must be correlated to theworkflow instance using the callback events context attribute defined in the correlation property of thereferenced Event Definition. Once the completion (callback) event is received, the Callback state completes its execution and transitions to the nextdefined workflow state or completes workflow execution in case it is an end state. The callback event payload is merged with the Callback state data and can be filtered via the "eventDataFilter" definition. If the defined callback event has not been received during this time period, the state should transition to the next state or end workflow execution if it is an end state. The timeouts property defines state specific timeout settings. Callback states can define thestateExecTimeout, actionExecTimeout, and eventTimeout properties.For more information on workflow timeouts reference the Workflow Timeoutssection. FUNCTION DEFINITION name Unique function name string yes operation If type is rest, #. If type is asyncapi, #. If type is rpc, ##. If type is graphql, #<literal "mutation" or "query">#. If type is odata, #. If type is expression, defines the workflow expression. string yes type Defines the function type. Can be either rest, asyncapi, rpc, graphql, odata, expression, or custom. Default is rest enum no authRef References an auth definition name to be used to access to resource defined in the operation parameter string no metadata Metadata information. Can be used to define custom function information object no "name": "HelloWorldFunction", "operation": "https://hellworldservice.api.com/api.json#helloWorld" name: HelloWorldFunction operation: https://hellworldservice.api.com/api.json#helloWorld The name property defines an unique name of the function definition. The type property defines the function type. Its value can be either rest or expression. Default value is rest. Depending on the function type, the operation property can be: If type is rest, a combination of the function/service OpenAPI definition document URI and the particular service operation that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'.For example https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json#getPetById. If type is asyncapi, a combination of the AsyncApi definition document URI and the particular service operation that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'.For example file://streetlightsapi.yaml#onLightMeasured. If type is rpc, a combination of the gRPC proto document URI and the particular service name and service method name that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'.For example file://myuserservice.proto#UserService#ListUsers. If type is graphql, a combination of the GraphQL schema definition URI and the particular service name and service method name that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'.For example file://myuserservice.proto#UserService#ListUsers. If type is odata, a combination of the GraphQL schema definition URI and the particular service name and service method name that needs to be invoked, separated by a '#'.For example https://services.odata.org/V3/OData/OData.svc#Products. If type is expression, defines the expression syntax. Take a look at the workflow expressions section for more information on this. Defining custom function types is possible, for more information on that refer to the Defining custom function types section. The authRef property references a name of a defined workflow auth definition.It is used to provide authentication info to access the resource defined in the operation property and/or to invoke the function. The metadata property allows users to define custom information to function definitions.This allows you for example to define functions that describe of a command executions on a Docker image: - name: whalesayimage metadata: image: docker/whalesay command: cowsay Note that using metadata for cases such as above heavily reduces the portability of your workflow markup. Function definitions themselves do not define data input parameters. Parameters can bedefined via the parameters property in function definitions inside actions. AuthRef Definition resource References an auth definition to be used to access the resource defined in the operation parameter string yes invocation References an auth definition to be used to invoke the operation string no The authRef property references a name of a defined workflow auth definition. It can be a string or an object. If it's a string, the referenced auth definition is used solely for the function's invocation. If it's an object, it is possible to specify an auth definition to use for the function's resource retrieval (as defined by the operation property) and another for its invocation. Example of a function definition configured to use an auth definition called "My Basic Auth" upon invocation: - name: SecuredFunctionInvocation operation: https://test.com/swagger.json#HelloWorld authRef: My Basic Auth Example of a function definition configured to use an auth definition called "My Basic Auth" to retrieve the resource defined by the operation property, and an auth definition called "My OIDC Auth" upon invocation: authRef: resource: My Basic Auth invocation: My OIDC Auth Note that if multiple functions share the same operation path (which is the first component of the operation value, located before the first '#' character), and if one of them defines an auth definition for resource access, then it should always be used to access said resource.In other words, when retrieving the resource of the function "MySecuredFunction2" defined in the following example, the "My Api Key Auth" auth definition should be used, because the "MySecuredFunction1" has defined it for resource access.This is done to avoid unnecessary repetitions of auth definition configuration when using the same resource for multiple defined functions. - name: MySecuredFunction1 operation: https://secure.resources.com/myapi.json#helloWorld authRef: resource: My ApiKey Auth - name: MySecuredFunction2 operation: https://secure.resources.com/myapi.json#holaMundo It's worth noting that if an auth definition has been defined for an OpenAPI function which's resource declare an authentication mechanism, the later should be used instead, thus ignoring entirely the auth definition. EVENT DEFINITION name Unique event name string yes source CloudEvent source. If not set when kind is produced, runtimes are expected to use a default value, such as https://serverlessworkflow.io in order to comply with the CloudEvent spec constraints) string yes (if type is not defined. type CloudEvent type string yes (if source is not defined) kind Defines the event is either consumed or produced by the workflow. Default is consumed enum no correlation Define event correlation rules for this event. Only used for consumed events array no dataOnly If true (default value), only the Event payload is accessible to consuming Workflow states. If false, both event payload and context attributes should be accessible boolean no "name": "ApplicantInfo", "type": "org.application.info", "source": "applicationssource", "kind": "consumed", "correlation": [ "contextAttributeName": "applicantId" name: ApplicantInfo type: org.application.info source: applicationssource kind: consumed correlation: - contextAttributeName: applicantId Used to define events and their correlations. These events can be either consumed or produced during workflow execution as wellas can be used to trigger function/service invocations. The Serverless Workflow specification mandates that all events conform to the CloudEvents specification.This is to assure consistency and portability of the events format used. The name property defines a single name of the event that is unique inside the workflow definition. This event name can bethen referenced within function and state definitions. The source property matches this event definition with the sourceproperty of the CloudEvent required attributes. The type property matches this event definition with the type property of the CloudEvent required attributes. The kind property defines this event as either consumed or produced. In terms of the workflow, this means it is either an eventthat triggers workflow instance creation, or continuation of workflow instance execution (consumed), or an eventthat the workflow instance creates during its execution (produced).The default value (if not specified) of the kind property is consumed.Note that for produced event definitions, implementations must provide the value of the CloudEvent source attribute.In this case (i.e., when the kind property is set to produced), the source property of the event is not required in the workflow definition.Otherwise, (i.e., when the kind property is set to consumed), the source property must be defined in the event definition. Event correlation plays a big role in large event-driven applications. Correlating one or more events with a particular workflow instancecan be done by defining the event correlation rules within the correlation property.This property is an array of correlation definitions.The CloudEvents specification allows users to add Extension Context Attributesand the correlation definitions can use these attributes to define clear matching event correlation rules.Extension context attributes are not part of the event payload, so they are serialized the same way as other standard required attributes.This means that the event payload does not have to be inspected by implementations in order to read and evaluate the defined correlation rules. Let's take a look at an example. Here we have two events that have an extension context attribute called "patientId" (as well as "department", whichwill be used in further examples below): "specversion" : "1.0", "type" : "com.hospital.patient.heartRateMonitor", "source" : "hospitalMonitorSystem", "subject" : "HeartRateReading", "id" : "A234-1234-1234", "time" : "2020-01-05T17:31:00Z", "patientId" : "PID-12345", "department": "UrgentCare", "data" : { "value": "80bpm" and "type" : "com.hospital.patient.bloodPressureMonitor", "subject" : "BloodPressureReading", "id" : "B234-1234-1234", "time" : "2020-02-05T17:31:00Z", "value": "110/70" We can then define a correlation rule, through which all consumed events with the "hospitalMonitorSystem", and the "com.hospital.patient.heartRateMonitor"type that have the same value of the patientId property to be correlated to the created workflow instance: "events": [ "name": "HeartRateReadingEvent", "source": "hospitalMonitorSystem", "type": "com.hospital.patient.heartRateMonitor", "kind": "consumed", "correlation": [ "contextAttributeName": "patientId" If a workflow instance is created (e.g., via Event state) by consuming a "HeartRateReadingEvent" event, all other consumed eventsfrom the defined source and with the defined type that have the same "patientId" as the event that triggered the workflow instanceshould then also be associated with the same instance. You can also correlate multiple events together. In the following example, we assume that the workflow consumes two different event types,and we want to make sure that both are correlated, as in the above example, with the same "patientId": "name": "BloodPressureReadingEvent", "source": "hospitalMonitorSystem", "type": "com.hospital.patient.bloodPressureMonitor", "contextAttributeName": "patientId" Event correlation can be based on equality (values of the defined "contextAttributeName" must be equal), but it can also be basedon comparing it to custom defined values (string, or expression). For example: "contextAttributeName": "department", "contextAttributeValue" : "UrgentCare" In this example, we have two correlation rules defined: The first one is on the "patientId" CloudEvent context attribute, meaning again thatall consumed events from this source and type must have the same "patientId" to be considered. The second rulesays that these events must all have a context attribute named "department" with the value of "UrgentCare". This allows developers to write orchestration workflows that are specifically targeted to patients that are in the hospital urgent care unit,for example. The dataOnly property deals with what Event data is accessible by the consuming Workflow states.If its value is true (default value), only the Event payload is accessible to consuming Workflow states.If false, both Event payload and context attributes should be accessible. AUTH DEFINITION Auth definitions can be used to define authentication information that should be applied to function definitions.It can be used for both the retrieval of the function's resource (as defined by the operation property) and for the function's invocation. name Unique auth definition name string yes scheme Auth scheme, can be "basic", "bearer", or "oauth2". Default is "basic" enum no properties Auth scheme properties. Can be one of "Basic properties definition", "Bearer properties definition", or "OAuth2 properties definition" object yes The name property defines the unique auth definition name.The scheme property defines the auth scheme to be used. Can be "bearer", "basic" or "oauth2".The properties property defines the auth scheme properties information.Can be one of "Basic properties definition", "Bearer properties definition", or "OAuth2 properties definition" See here for more information about Basic Authentication scheme. The Basic properties definition can have two types, either string or object.If string type, it defines a workflow expression that contains all needed Basic auth information.If object type, it has the following properties: username String or a workflow expression. Contains the user name string yes password String or a workflow expression. Contains the user password string yes See here for more information about Bearer Authentication scheme. token String or a workflow expression. Contains the token information string yes See here for more information about OAuth2 Authentication scheme. authority String or a workflow expression. Contains the authority information string no grantType Defines the grant type. Can be "password", "clientCredentials", or "tokenExchange" enum yes clientId String or a workflow expression. Contains the client identifier string yes clientSecret Workflow secret or a workflow expression. Contains the client secret string no scopes Array containing strings or workflow expressions. Contains the OAuth2 scopes array no username String or a workflow expression. Contains the user name. Used only if grantType is 'resourceOwner' string no password String or a workflow expression. Contains the user password. Used only if grantType is 'resourceOwner' string no audiences Array containing strings or workflow expressions. Contains the OAuth2 audiences array no subjectToken String or a workflow expression. Contains the subject token string no requestedSubject String or a workflow expression. Contains the requested subject string no requestedIssuer String or a workflow expression. Contains the requested issuer string no CORRELATION DEFINITION contextAttributeName CloudEvent Extension Context Attribute name string yes contextAttributeValue CloudEvent Extension Context Attribute value string no "contextAttributeName": "department", "contextAttributeValue" : "UrgentCare" - contextAttributeName: patientId - contextAttributeName: department contextAttributeValue: UrgentCare Used to define event correlation rules. Only usable for consumed event definitions. The contextAttributeName property defines the name of the CloudEvent extension context attribute.The contextAttributeValue property defines the value of the defined CloudEvent extension context attribute. ONEVENTS DEFINITION eventRefs References one or more unique event names in the defined workflow events array yes actionMode Specifies how actions are to be performed (in sequence or in parallel). Default is sequential enum no actions Actions to be performed array no eventDataFilter Event data filter definition object no "eventRefs": ["HighBodyTemperature"], "actions": [{ "refName": "sendTylenolOrder", "patientid": "${ .patientId }" eventRefs: - HighBodyTemperature refName: sendTylenolOrder patientid: "${ .patientId }" OnEvent definition allow you to define which actions are to be performedfor the one or more events definitions defined in the eventRefs array.Note that the values of eventRefs array must be unique. The actionMode property defines if the defined actions need to be performed sequentially or in parallel. The actions property defines a list of actions to be performed. When specifying the onEvents definition it is important to consider the Event states exclusive property,because it determines how 'onEvents' is interpreted.Let's look at the following JSON definition of 'onEvents' to show this: "onEvents": [{ "eventRefs": ["HighBodyTemperature", "HighBloodPressure"], "refName": "SendTylenolOrder", "patient": "${ .patientId }" "refName": "CallNurse", Depending on the value of the Event states exclusive property, this definition can mean two different things: If exclusive is set to true, the consumption of either the HighBodyTemperature or HighBloodPressure events will trigger action execution. If exclusive is set to false, the consumption of both the HighBodyTemperature and HighBloodPressure events will trigger action execution. This is visualized in the diagram below: ACTION DEFINITION name Unique Action name string no functionRef References a reusable function definition object or string yes (if eventRef & subFlowRef are not defined) eventRef References a produce and consume reusable event definitions object yes (if functionRef & subFlowRef are not defined) subFlowRef References a workflow to be invoked object or string yes (if eventRef & functionRef are not defined) retryRef References a defined workflow retry definition. If not defined uses the default runtime retry definition string no nonRetryableErrors List of references to defined workflow errors for which the action should not be retried. Used only when autoRetries is set to true array no retryableErrors List of references to defined workflow errors for which the action should be retried. Used only when autoRetries is set to false array no actionDataFilter Action data filter definition object no sleep Defines time periods workflow execution should sleep before / after function execution object no condition Expression, if defined, must evaluate to true for this action to be performed. If false, action is disregarded string no "name": "Finalize Application Action", "functionRef": { "refName": "finalizeApplicationFunction", "arguments": { "applicantid": "${ .applicantId }" name: Finalize Application Action functionRef: refName: finalizeApplicationFunction arguments: applicantid: "${ .applicantId }" Actions specify invocations of services or other workflows during workflow execution.Service invocation can be done in three different ways: Reference functions definitions by its unique name using the functionRef property. Reference a produced and consumed event definitions via the eventRef property. Reference a sub-workflow invocation via the subFlowRef property. Note that functionRef, eventRef, and subFlowRef are mutually exclusive, meaning that only one of them can bespecified in a single action definition. The name property specifies the action name. In the event-based scenario a service, or a set of services we want to invokeare not exposed via a specific resource URI for example, but can only be invoked via an event.The eventRef property defines thereferenced produced event via its produceEventRef property and a consumed event via its consumeEventRef property. The sleep property can be used to define time periods that workflow execution should sleepbefore and/or after function execution. It can have two properties: before - defines the amount of time (ISO 8601 duration format) to sleep before function invocation. after - defines the amount of time (ISO 8601 duration format) to sleep after function invocation. Function invocation timeouts should be handled via the states timeouts definition. The retryRef property references one of the defined workflow retries by it's unique name. If not set, the actionshould be retried according to the default retry policy of the runtime implementation. For more information about workflowretries reference this section. The nonRetryableErrors property is a list that references one or more unique names of workflow error definitions.This is the list of known errors for which the action should not be retried for.It should be used only when the workflow top-level autoRetries property is set to true. The retryableErrors property is a list that references one or more unique names of workflow error definitions.This is the list of known errors for which the action should be retried for.It should be used only when the workflow top-level autoRetries property is set to false. The condition property is a workflow expression. If defined, it must evaluate to truefor this action to be performed. If it evaluates to false the action is skipped.If the condition property is not defined, the action is always performed. SUBFLOW ACTION Often you want to group your workflows into small logical units that solve a particular business problem and can be reused inmultiple other workflow definitions. Reusable workflows are referenced by their id property via the SubFlow action workflowId parameter. For the simple case, subFlowRef can be a string containing the id of the sub-workflow to invoke.If you want to specify other parameters then a subFlowRef should be provided instead. Each referenced workflow receives the SubFlow actions data as workflow data input. Referenced sub-workflows must declare their own function and event definitions. FUNCTIONREF DEFINITION FunctionRef definition can have two types, either string or object.If string type, it defines the name of the referenced function.This can be used as a short-cut definition when you don't need to define any other parameters, for example: "functionRef": "myFunction" Note that if used with string type, the invocation of the function is synchronous. If you need to define parameters in your functionRef definition, you can defineit with its object type which has the following properties: refName Name of the referenced function string yes arguments Arguments (inputs) to be passed to the referenced function object yes (if function type is graphql, otherwise no) selectionSet Used if function type is graphql. String containing a valid GraphQL selection set string yes (if function type is graphql, otherwise no) invoke Specifies if the function should be invoked sync or async. Default is sync enum no "refName": "finalizeApplicationFunction", "arguments": { "applicantid": "${ .applicantId }" refName: finalizeApplicationFunction arguments: applicantid: "${ .applicantId }" The refName property is the name of the referenced function. The arguments property defines the arguments that are to be passed to the referenced function.Here is an example of using the arguments property: "refName": "checkFundsAvailabe", "arguments": { "account": { "id": "${ .accountId }" "forAmount": "${ .payment.amount }", "insufficientMessage": "The requested amount is not available." The invoke property defines how the function is invoked (sync or async). Default value of this property issync, meaning that workflow execution should wait until the function completes.If set to async, workflow execution should just invoke the function and should not wait until its completion.Note that in this case the action does not produce any results and the associated actions actionDataFilter as well asits retry definition, if defined, should be ignored.In addition, functions that are invoked async do not propagate their errors to the associated action definition and theworkflow state, meaning that any errors that happen during their execution cannot be handled in the workflow statesonErrors definition. Note that errors raised during functions that are invoked async should not fail workflow execution. EVENTREF DEFINITION Allows defining invocation of a function via event. produceEventRef Reference to the unique name of a produced event definition string yes consumeEventRef Reference to the unique name of a consumed event definition string no consumeEventTimeout Maximum amount of time (ISO 8601 format) to wait for the consume event. If not defined it be set to the actionExecutionTimeout string no data If string type, an expression which selects parts of the states data output to become the data (payload) of the event referenced by produceEventRef. If object type, a custom object to become the data (payload) of the event referenced by produceEventRef. string or object no contextAttributes Add additional event extension context attributes to the trigger/produced event object no "eventRef": { "produceEventRef": "MakeVetAppointment", "data": "${ .patientInfo }", "consumeEventRef": "VetAppointmentInfo" eventRef: produceEventRef: MakeVetAppointment data: "${ .patientInfo }" consumeEventRef: VetAppointmentInfo References a produced and consumed event definitions via the produceEventRef and consumeEventRef properties, respectively. The data property can have two types: string or object. If it is of string type, it is an expression that can select parts of state datato be used as payload of the event referenced by produceEventRef. If it is of object type, you can define a custom object to be the event payload. The contextAttributes property allows you to add one or more extension context attributesto the trigger/produced event. The consumeEventTimeout property defines the maximum amount of time (ISO 8601 format) to wait for the result event. If not defined it should default to the actionExecutionTimeout.If the event defined by the consumeEventRef property is not received in that set time, action invocation should raise an errorthat can be handled in the states onErrors definition. In case the consumeEventRef is not defined, the consumeEventTimeout property is ignored. The invoke property defines how the function is invoked (sync or async). Default value of this property issync, meaning that workflow execution should wait until the function completes (the result event is received).If set to async, workflow execution should just produce the trigger event and should not wait for the result event.Note that in this case the action does not produce any results (payload of the result event) and the associated actions eventDataFilter as well asits retry definition, if defined, should be ignored.Functions that are invoked via events (sync or async) do not propagate their errors to the associated action definition and theworkflow state, meaning that any errors that happen during their execution cannot be handled in the workflow statesonErrors definition. Note that errors raised during functions that are invoked sync or async in this caseshould not fail workflow execution. SUBFLOWREF DEFINITION SubFlowRef definition can have two types, namely string or object. If string type, it defines the unique id of the sub-workflow to be invoked.This short-hand definition can be used if sub-workflow lookup is done only by its idproperty and not its version property. "subFlowRef": "mySubFlowId" If you need to define the version properties, you can use its object type: workflowId Sub-workflow unique id string yes version Sub-workflow version string no invoke Specifies if the subflow should be invoked sync or async. Default is sync enum no onParentComplete If invoke is async, specifies if subflow execution should terminate or continue when parent workflow completes. Default is terminate enum no "workflowId": "handleApprovedVisaWorkflowID", "version": "2.0.0" workflowId: handleApprovedVisaWorkflowID version: '2.0.0' The workflowId property define the unique ID of the sub-workflow to be invoked.Usually, the workflow id should not be the same id of the workflow where the action is defined. Otherwise, it may occur undesired recurring calls to the same workflow. The version property defined the unique version of the sub-workflow to be invoked.If this property is defined, runtimes should match both the id and the version propertiesdefined in the sub-workflow definition. The invoke property defines how the subflow is invoked (sync or async). Default value of this property issync, meaning that workflow execution should wait until the subflow completes.If set to async, workflow execution should just invoke the subflow and not wait for its results.Note that in this case the action does not produce any results, and the associated actions actionDataFilter as well asits retry definition, if defined, should be ignored.Subflows that are invoked async do not propagate their errors to the associated action definition and theworkflow state, meaning that any errors that happen during their execution cannot be handled in the workflow statesonErrors definition. Note that errors raised during subflows that are invoked asyncshould not fail workflow execution. The onParentComplete property defines how subflow execution that is invoked async should behave if the parent workflowcompletes execution before the subflow completes its own execution.The default value of this property is terminate, meaning that if the parent workflow (the workflow that invoked the subflow)completes, execution of the subflow should be terminated.If it is set to continue, if the parent workflow completes, the subflow execution is allowed to continue its own execution. ERROR DEFINITION errorRef or errorRefs Reference one unique workflow error definition, or multiple unique workflow error definitions string (errorRef) or array (errorRefs) yes transition Transition to next state to handle the error string or object yes (if end is not defined) end End workflow execution if this error is encountered boolean or object yes (if transition is not defined) "errorRef": "Item not in inventory", "transition": "IssueRefundToCustomer" errorRef: Item not in inventory transition: IssueRefundToCustomer Error definitions describe checked errors that can occur during workflow execution and how to handle them. The errorRef property references the unique workflow error definition. For more info on workflow error handlingreferece this section. The errorRefsproperty references at least one of the defined workflow error definitions.Can be used when errorRef is not used. Usable when you want to define multiple error refs for which the same transitionor end definition should be applied.For more info on workflow error handlingreferece this section. Note that the errorRef and errorRefs properties are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can only specify one or the other,but not both at the same time. The transition property defines the transition to the next workflow state in cases when the definederror happens during runtime execution. If transition is not defined you can also define the end property which will end workflow execution at that point.Note that the transition and end properties are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can only specify one or the other,but not both at the same time. For more information, see the Workflow Error Handling sections. RETRY DEFINITION name Unique retry strategy name string yes delay Time delay between retry attempts (ISO 8601 duration format) string no maxAttempts Maximum number of retry attempts. Value of 1 means no retries are performed string or number yes maxDelay Maximum amount of delay between retry attempts (ISO 8601 duration format) string no increment Static duration which will be added to the delay between successive retries (ISO 8601 duration format) string no multiplier Float value by which the delay is multiplied before each attempt. For example: "1.2" meaning that each successive delay is 20% longer than the previous delay. For example, if delay is 'PT10S', then the delay between the first and second attempts will be 10 seconds, and the delay before the third attempt will be 12 seconds. float or string no jitter If float type, maximum amount of random time added or subtracted from the delay between each retry relative to total delay (between 0.0 and 1.0). If string type, absolute maximum amount of random time added or subtracted from the delay between each retry (ISO 8601 duration format) float or string no "name": "TimeoutRetryStrat", "delay": "PT2M", "maxAttempts": 3, "jitter": "PT0.001S" name: TimeoutRetryStrat delay: PT2M maxAttempts: 3 jitter: PT0.001S Defines the states retry policy (strategy). This is an explicit definition and can be reused across multipledefined state actions. The name property specifies the unique name of the retry definition (strategy). This unique namecan be referred by workflow states error definitions. The delay property specifies the initial time delay between retry attempts (ISO 8601 duration format). The increment property specifies a static duration which will be added to the delay between successive retries.To explain this better, let's say we have the following retry definition: "name": "Timeout Errors Strategy", "delay": "PT10S", "increment": "PT2S", "maxAttempts": 4 which means that we will retry up to 4 times after waiting with increasing delay between attempts;in this example 10, 12, 14, and 16 seconds between retries. The multiplier property specifies the value by which the interval time is increased for each of the retry attempts.To explain this better, let's say we have the following retry definition: "multiplier": 2, which means that we will retry up to 4 times after waiting with increasing delay between attempts;in this example 10, 20, 40, and 80 seconds between retries. If both increment and multiplier properties are defined, increment should be applied first and thenthe multiplier when determining the next retry time. The maxAttempts property determines the maximum number of retry attempts allowed and is a positive integer value. The jitter property is important to prevent certain scenarios where clientsare retrying in sync, possibly causing or contributing to a transient failureprecisely because they're retrying at the same time. Adding a typically small,bounded random amount of time to the period between retries serves the purposeof attempting to prevent these retries from happening simultaneously, possiblyreducing total time to complete requests and overall congestion. How this valueis used in the exponential backoff algorithm is left up to implementations. jitter may be specified as a percentage relative to the total delay.Once the next retry attempt delay is calculated, we can apply jitter as a percentage value relative to thiscalculated delay. For example, if your calculated delay for the next retry is six seconds, and we specifya jitter value of 0.3, a random amount of time between 0 and 1.8 (0.3 times 6) is to be added or subtractedfrom the calculated delay. Alternatively, jitter may be defined as an absolute value specified as an ISO8601 duration. This way, the maximum amount of random time added is fixed andwill not increase as new attempts are made. The maxDelay property determines the maximum amount of delay that is desired between retry attempts, and is appliedafter increment, multiplier, and jitter. To explain this better, let's say we have the following retry definition: "maxDelay": "PT100S", "multiplier": 4, "jitter": "PT1S", which means that we will retry up to 4 times after waiting with increasing delay between attempts;in this example we might observe the following series of delays: 11s (min(maxDelay, (delay +/- rand(jitter)) => min(100, 10 + 1)) 43s (min(maxDelay, (11s * multiplier) +/- rand(jitter)) => min(100, (11 * 4) - 1)) 100s (min(maxDelay, (43s * multiplier) +/- rand(jitter)) => min(100, (43 * 4) + 0)) 100s (min(maxDelay, (100s * multiplier) +/- rand(jitter)) => min(100, (100 * 4) - 1)) TRANSITION DEFINITION Transition definition can have two types, either string or object.If string, it defines the name of the state to transition to.This can be used as a short-cut definition when you don't need to define any other parameters, for example: "transition": "myNextState" If you need to define additional parameters in your transition definition, you can defineit with its object type which has the following properties: nextState Name of the state to transition to next string yes compensate If set to true, triggers workflow compensation before this transition is taken. Default is false boolean no produceEvents Array of producedEvent definitions. Events to be produced before the transition takes place array no "produceEvents": [{ "eventRef": "produceResultEvent", "data": "${ .result.data }" }], "nextState": "EvalResultState" produceEvents: - eventRef: produceResultEvent data: "${ .result.data }" nextState: EvalResultState The nextState property defines the name of the state to transition to next.The compensate property allows you to trigger compensation before the transition (if set to true).The produceEvents property allows you to define a list of events to produce before the transition happens. Transitions allow you to move from one state (control-logic block) to another. For more information see theTransitions section section. SWITCH STATE DATA CONDITIONS name Data condition name string no condition Workflow expression evaluated against state data. Must evaluate to true or false string yes transition Transition to another state if condition is true string or object yes (if end is not defined) end End workflow execution if condition is true boolean or object yes (if transition is not defined) "name": "Eighteen or older", "condition": "${ .applicant | .age >= 18 }", "transition": "StartApplication" name: Eighteen or older condition: "${ .applicant | .age >= 18 }" transition: StartApplication Switch state data conditions specify a data-based condition statement, which causes a transition to anotherworkflow state if evaluated to true.The condition property of the condition defines an expression (e.g., ${ .applicant | .age > 18 }), which selectsparts of the state data input. The condition must evaluate to true or false. If the condition is evaluated to true, you can specify either the transition or end definitionsto decide what to do, transition to another workflow state, or end workflow execution. Note that transition and enddefinitions are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can specify either one or the other, but not both. SWITCH STATE EVENT CONDITIONS name Event condition name string no eventRef References an unique event name in the defined workflow events string yes "name": "Visa approved", "eventRef": "visaApprovedEvent", "transition": "HandleApprovedVisa" name: Visa approved eventRef: visaApprovedEvent transition: HandleApprovedVisa Switch state event conditions specify events, which the switch state must wait for. Each conditioncan reference one workflow-defined event. Upon arrival of this event, the associated transition is taken.The eventRef property references a name of one of the defined workflow events. If the referenced event is received, you can specify either the transition or end definitionsto decide what to do, transition to another workflow state, or end workflow execution. The eventDataFilter property can be used to filter event data when it is received. Note that transition and enddefinitions are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can specify either one or the other, but not both. PARALLEL STATE BRANCH name Branch name string yes actions Actions to be executed in this branch array yes timeouts Branch specific timeout settings object no "name": "Branch1", "functionRef": { "refName": "functionNameOne", "arguments": { "order": "${ .someParam }" "refName": "functionNameTwo", "order": "${ .someParamTwo }" name: Branch1 refName: functionNameOne order: "${ .someParam }" refName: functionNameTwo order: "${ .someParamTwo }" Each branch receives the same copy of the Parallel state's data input. A branch can define actions that need to be executed. For the SubFlowRef action, the workflow id should not be the same id of the workflow where the branch is defined. Otherwise, it may occur undesired recurring calls to the same workflow. The timeouts property can be used to set branch specific timeout settings. Parallel state branches can set theactionExecTimeout and branchExecTimeout timeout properties. For more information on workflow timeouts reference theWorkflow Timeouts section. PARALLEL STATE HANDLING EXCEPTIONS Exceptions can occur during execution of Parallel state branches. By default, exceptions that are not handled within branches stop branch execution and are propagatedto the Parallel state and should be handled with its onErrors definition. If the parallel states branch defines actions, all exceptions that arise from executing these actions (after allallotted retries are exhausted)are propagated to the parallel stateand can be handled with the parallel states onErrors definition. If the parallel states defines a subflow action, exceptions that occur during execution of the called workflowcan choose to handle exceptions on their own. All unhandled exceptions from the called workflowexecution however are propagated back to the parallel state and can be handled with the parallel statesonErrors definition. Note that once an error that is propagated to the parallel state from a branch and handled by thestates onErrors definition is handled (its associated transition is taken) no further errors from branches of thisparallel state should be considered as the workflow control flow logic has already moved to a different state. START DEFINITION Can be either string or object type. If type string, it defines the name of the workflow starting state. "start": "MyStartingState" In this case it's assumed that the schedule property is not defined. If the start definition is of type object, it has the following structure: stateName Name of the starting workflow state string no schedule Define the recurring time intervals or cron expressions at which workflow instances should be automatically started. string or object yes "stateName": "MyStartingstate", "schedule": "2020-03-20T09:00:00Z/PT2H" stateName: MyStartingstate schedule: 2020-03-20T09:00:00Z/PT2H Start definition explicitly defines how/when workflow instances should be created and what the workflow starting state is. The start definition can be either string or object type. If string type, it defines the name of the workflow starting state. If object type, it provides the ability to set the workflow starting state name, as well as the schedule property. The stateName property can be set to define the starting workflow state. If not specified, the first statein the workflow states definition should be used as the starting workflow state. The schedule property allows to define scheduled workflow instance creation.Scheduled starts have two different choices. You can define a recurring time interval or cron-based schedule at which a workflowinstance should be created (automatically). You can also define cron-based scheduled starts, which allows you to specify periodically started workflow instances based on a cron definition.Cron-based scheduled starts can handle absolute time intervals (i.e., not calculated in respect to some particular point in time).One use case for cron-based scheduled starts is a workflow that performs periodical data batch processing.In this case we could use a cron definition 0 0/5 * * * ? to define that a workflow instance from the workflow definition should be created every 5 minutes, starting at full hour. Here are some more examples of cron expressions and their meanings: * * * * * - Create workflow instance at the top of every minute 0 * * * * - Create workflow instance at the top of every hour 0 */2 * * * - Create workflow instance every 2 hours 0 9 8 * * - Create workflow instance at 9:00:00AM on the eighth day of every month See here to get more information on defining cron expressions. One thing to discuss when dealing with cron-based scheduled starts is when the workflow starting state is an Event.Event states define that workflow instances are triggered by the existence of the defined event(s).Defining a cron-based scheduled starts for the runtime implementations would mean that there needs to be an event service that issuesthe needed events at the defined times to trigger workflow instance creation. Defining a start definition is not required. If it's not defined, the starting workflowstate has to be the very first state defined in the workflow states array. SCHEDULE DEFINITION Schedule definition can have two types, either string or object.If string type, it defines time interval describing when the workflow instance should be automatically created.This can be used as a short-cut definition when you don't need to define any other parameters, for example: "schedule": "R/PT2H" If you need to define the cron or the timezone parameters in your schedule definition, you can defineit with its object type which has the following properties: interval A recurring time interval expressed in the derivative of ISO 8601 format specified below. Declares that workflow instances should be automatically created at the start of each time interval in the series. string yes (if cron is not defined) cron Cron expression defining when workflow instances should be automatically created object yes (if interval is not defined) timezone Timezone name used to evaluate the interval & cron-expression. If the interval specifies a date-time w/ timezone then proper timezone conversion will be applied. (default: UTC). string no "cron": "0 0/15 * * * ?" cron: 0 0/15 * * * ? The interval property uses a derivative of ISO 8601 recurring time interval format to describe a series of consecutive time intervals for workflow instances to be automatically created at the start of. Unlike full ISO 8601, this derivative format does not allow expression of an explicit number of recurrences or identification of a series by the date and time at the start and end of its first time interval.There are three ways to express a recurring interval: R/<Start>/<Duration>: Defines the start time and a duration, for example: "R/2020-03-20T13:00:00Z/PT2H", meaning workflowinstances will be automatically created every 2 hours starting from March 20th 2020 at 1pm UTC. R/<Duration>/<End>: Defines a duration and an end, for example: "R/PT2H/2020-05-11T15:30:00Z", meaning that workflow instances will beautomatically created every 2 hours until until May 11th 2020 at 3:30pm UTC (i.e., the last instance will be created 2 hours prior to that, at 1:30pm UTC). R/<Duration>: Defines a duration only, for example: "R/PT2H", meaning workflow instances will be automatically created every 2 hours. The start time of the first interval may be indeterminate, but should be delayed by no more than the specified duration and must repeat on schedule after that (this is effectively supplying the start time "out-of-band" as permitted ISO ISO 8601-1:2019 section 5.6.1 NOTE 1). Each runtime implementation should document how the start time for a duration-only interval is established. The cron property uses a cron expressionto describe a repeating interval upon which a workflow instance should be created automatically.For more information see the cron definition section. The timezone property is used to define a time zone name to evaluate the cron or interval expression against. If not specified, it should defaultto UTC time zone. See here for a list of timezone names. For ISO 8601 date timevalues in interval or cron.validUntil, runtimes should treat timezone as the 'local time' (UTC if timezone is not defined by the user). Note that when the workflow starting state is an Eventdefining cron-based scheduled starts for the runtime implementations would mean that there needs to be an event service that issuesthe needed events at the defined times to trigger workflow instance creation. CRON DEFINITION Cron definition can have two types, either string or object.If string type, it defines the cron expression describing when the workflow instance should be created (automatically).This can be used as a short-cut definition when you don't need to define any other parameters, for example: "cron": "0 15,30,45 * ? * *" If you need to define the validUntil parameters in your cron definition, you can defineit with its object type which has the following properties: expression Cron expression describing when the workflow instance should be created (automatically) string yes validUntil Specific date and time (ISO 8601 format) when the cron expression is no longer valid string no "expression": "0 15,30,45 * ? * *", "validUntil": "2021-11-05T08:15:30-05:00" expression: 0 15,30,45 * ? * * validUntil: '2021-11-05T08:15:30-05:00' The expression property is a a cron expression which defineswhen workflow instances should be created (automatically). The validUntil property defines a date and time (using ISO 8601 format). When thevalidUntil time is reached, the cron expression for instances creations of this workflowshould no longer be valid. For example let's say we have to following cron definitions: This tells the runtime engine to create an instance of this workflow every hourat minutes 15, 30 and 45. This is to be done until November 5, 2021, 8:15:30 am, US Eastern Standard Timeas defined by the validUntil property value. END DEFINITION Can be either boolean or object type. If type boolean, must be set to true, for example: "end": true In this case it's assumed that the terminate property has its default value of false, and the produceEvents,compensate, and continueAs properties are not defined. If the end definition is of type object, it has the following structure: terminate If true. terminates workflow instance execution boolean no produceEvents Array of producedEvent definitions. Defines events that should be produced. array no compensate If set to true, triggers workflow compensation before workflow execution completes. Default is false boolean no continueAs Defines that current workflow execution should stop, and execution should continue as a new workflow instance of the provided id string or object no "terminate": true, "produceEvents": [{ "eventRef": "provisioningCompleteEvent", "data": "${ .provisionedOrders }" terminate: true - eventRef: provisioningCompleteEvent data: "${ .provisionedOrders }" End definitions are used to explicitly define execution completion of a workflow instance or workflow execution path.A workflow definition must include at least one workflow state.Note that Switch states cannot declare to be workflow end states. Their conditions however candefine a stop of workflow execution. The terminate property, if set to true, completes the workflow instance execution, this any other activeexecution paths.If a terminate end is reached inside a ForEach or Parallel state the entire workflow instance is terminated. The produceEvents allows defining events which should be producedby the workflow instance before workflow stops its execution. It's important to mention that if the workflow keepActive property is set totrue,the only way to complete execution of the workflow instanceis if workflow execution reaches a state that defines an end definition with terminate property set to true,or, if the workflowExecTimeout property is defined, the time defined in its intervalis reached. The compensate property defines that workflow compensation should be performed before the workflowexecution is completed. The continueAs property defines that the current workflow instance should stop its execution,and worklow execution should continue as a new instance of a new workflow.When defined, it should be assumed that terminate is true. If continueAs is defined, and terminate is explicitlyset to false, runtimes should report this to users. Producing events, and compensation should still be performed (if defined)before the workflow execution is stopped, and continued as a new workflow instance with the defined workflow id. PRODUCEDEVENT DEFINITION eventRef Reference to a defined unique event name in the events definition string yes data If string type, an expression which selects parts of the states data output to become the data (payload) of the produced event. If object type, a custom object to become the data (payload) of produced event. string or object no contextAttributes Add additional event extension context attributes object no "eventRef": "provisioningCompleteEvent", "data": "${ .provisionedOrders }", "contextAttributes": [{ "buyerId": "${ .buyerId }" }] eventRef: provisioningCompleteEvent data: "${ .provisionedOrders }" contextAttributes: - buyerId: "${ .buyerId }" Defines the event (CloudEvent format) to be produced when workflow execution completes or during a workflow transitions.The eventRef property must match the name ofone of the defined produced events in the events definition. The data property can have two types, object or string. If of string type, it is an expression that can select parts of state datato be used as the event payload. If of object type, you can define a custom object to be the event payload. The contextAttributes property allows you to add one or more extension context attributesto the generated event. Being able to produce events when workflow execution completes or during state transitionallows for event-based orchestration communication.For example, completion of an orchestration workflow can notify other orchestration workflows to decide if they need to act uponthe produced event, or notify monitoring services of the current state of workflow execution, etc.It can be used to create very dynamic orchestration scenarios. TRANSITIONS Serverless workflow states can have one or more incoming and outgoing transitions (from/to other states).Each state can define a transition definition that is used to determine whichstate to transition to next. Implementers must use the unique State name property for determining the transition. Events can be produced during state transitions. The produceEvents property of the transition definitions allows youto reference one or more defined produced events in the workflow events definitions.For each of the produced events you can select what parts of state data to be the event payload. Transitions can trigger compensation via their compensate property. See the Workflow Compensationsection for more information. ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES Specifying additional properties, namely properties which are not defined by the specificationare only allowed in the Workflow Definition.Additional properties serve the same purpose as Workflow Metadata.They allow you to enrich the workflow definition with custom information. Additional properties, just like workflow metadata, should not affect workflow execution.Implementations may choose to use additional properties or ignore them. It is recommended to use workflow metadata instead of additional properties in the workflow definition. Let's take a look at an example of additional properties: "id": "myworkflow", "name": "My Test Workflow", "start": "My First State", "loglevel": "Info", "environment": "Production", "category": "Sales", "states": [ ... ] In this example, we specify the loglevel, environment, and category additional properties. Note the same can be also specified using workflow metadata, which is the preferred approach: "name": "Py Test Workflow", "metadata": { "loglevel": "Info", "environment": "Production", "category": "Sales" Serverless Workflow language allows you to define explicit error handling, meaning you can define what should happenin case of errors inside your workflow model rather than some generic error handling entity.This allows error handling to become part of your orchestration activities and as such part of your business problemsolutions. The idea behind the way Serverless Workflow defines error handling is that workflows should only fail due to unknown bugsduring execution. In general, you should always write your workflows so that they do not fail on any known failures. Each workflow state can define error handling, which is related only to errors that may arise during itsexecution. Error handling defined in one state cannot be used to handle errors that happened during execution of another stateduring workflow execution. Unknown errors that may arise during workflow state execution that are not explicitly handled within the workflow definitionshould be reported by runtime implementations and halt workflow execution. Within workflow definitions, errors defined are domain specific, meaning they are defined withinthe actual business domain, rather than their technical (programming-language-specific) description. For example, we can define errors such as "Order not found", or "Item not in inventory", rather than having touse terms such as "java.lang.IllegalAccessError", or "response.status == 404", whichmight make little to no sense to our specific problem domain, as well as may not be portable across various runtime implementations. In addition to the domain specific error name, users have the option to also add an optional error codeto help runtime implementations with mapping defined errors to concrete underlying technical ones. Runtime implementations must be able to map the error domain specific name (and the optional error code)to concrete technical errors that arise during workflow execution. Known workflow errors, that we know we need to handle during workflow execution should be defined inthe workflow top-level 'errors' property. This property can be either a string type, meaning it can referencea reusable JSON or Yaml definition file including the error definitions, or it can have an array type where you candefine these checked errors in-line in your workflow definition. Here is an example of such a definition for both cases: Referencing a reusable JSON/Yaml error definition file: "errors": "file://documents/reusable/errors.json" errors: file://documents/reusable/errors.json Defining workflow errors in-line: "errors": [ "name": "Service not found error", "code": "404", "description": "Server has not found anything matching the provided service endpoint information" errors: - name: Service not found error code: '404' description: Server has not found anything matching the provided service endpoint information These defined errors can then be referenced by their unique name in both states onErrors definitions as well as inactions nonRetryableErrors and retryableErrors properties. Retries allow workflows to deal with intermittent failures of services they are trying to invoke.In addition, retries allow workflows to continue (not fail) execution and allow us to fix possible errors with invokedservices and continue execution after they are fixed.Retries are important for both short-lived and long-lived workflows, as well as in both stateless and statefulscenarios. Serverless workflow supports two distinct ways of defining retries: Retrying on specified known (checked) errors. Automatic retrying on both known (checked) and not-known (unchecked) errors. Which retry option the workflow should use by default is defined via the workflow top-level autoRetries property.By default, the value of the autoRetries is set to false, meaning that retry option 1) is used by default.You can enable automatic retrying (option 2) by setting autoRetries to true. Regardless of the chosen retries option, note that workflows in general should be designed to not fail.Workflows should be able to recover from intermittent failures. The next sections provide more details to each action retry option. This is the default option when the workflow top-level autoRetries property is not specified or is set to false.This retry options is suited for stateless / short-running workflows where retries should be performed when specificallywanted. Note that in this scenario when unknown (unchecked) errors happen during action execution (service invocation),workflow execution should fail. Let's take a look at an example. To start, let's define a workflow top-level retries definition: "retries": [ "name": "FirstRetryStrategy", "delay": "PT1M", "maxAttempts": 5 "name": "SecondRetryStrategy", "delay": "PT10M", "maxAttempts": 10 retries: - name: FirstRetryStrategy delay: PT1M maxAttempts: 5 - name: SecondRetryStrategy delay: PT10M maxAttempts: 10 Our retries definitions can be referenced by actions. For example: "actions": [ "functionRef": "MyFirstFunction", "retryRef": "FirstRetryStrategy", "retryableErrors": ["SomeErrorOne", "SomeErrorTwo"] "functionRef": "MySecondFunction", "retryRef": "SecondRetryStrategy", "retryableErrors": ["SomeErrorTwo", "SomeErrorThree"] "functionRef": "MyThirdFunction" - functionRef: MyFirstFunction retryRef: FirstRetryStrategy nonRetryableErrors: - SomeErrorOne - SomeErrorTwo - functionRef: MySecondFunction retryRef: SecondRetryStrategy - SomeErrorThree - functionRef: MyThirdFunction Each action can define the retry strategy it wants to use. If it does not define one, the action is in this case not retries.Actions can define a list of known errors in its retryableErrors array. If defined, then the action should be retriedfor those errors according to the referenced retry strategy. In our example, "MyFirstFunction" invocation should be retried according to the "FirstRetryStrategy" policy only on known errors"SomeErrorOne" and "SomeErrorTwo". If for a known error (defined in retryableErrors) the retry limit is reached and the error still persist, it can be handled in the statesonErrors definition. If an unknown (unchecked) error happens during action execution, and this error is also not handled in the states onErrors definition, theworkflow execution should fail. This is the option used when the workflow top-level autoRetries property is set to true.Automatic retries are well suited to long-running and stateful workflow orchestrations. It allows workflowsto recover from failures thus providing more resilience. There is a possible cost associated with automatic retriesin terms of resource and computing power utilization. With this retries option, action executions should be retried automatically for both known (checked) as well as unknown (unchecked)errors. This means that you do not have to define a retry strategy for actions for them to have retried, it's included by default.Users can still define a custom retry strategy for each action via the retryRef property. If a retry strategy is not defined, a default retry strategy should be used.Runtime implementations can define their own default retry strategy. Serverless Workflow recommends the following settings: maxAttempts to be unlimited, meaning that the action should be retried indefinitely until successful. delay to be set to one second, meaning that there is a one second delay between action retries. multiplier to be set to two meaning that the delay should be multiplied by two for each retry attempt. Runtimes should document their default retry strategy to users, so it's clear whichproperty values they are using for the default. Actions can define for which known (checked) errors they should not be retried for.This is done via the actions nonRetryableErrors property. If a known error happens during action executionwhich is included in the nonRetryableErrors property array, that action should not be retried and the errorthen should be handled in the workflow states onErrors property. Let's take a look at an examples of defining retries when using the automatic retries option.This example assumes that the workfow top level autoRetries property is set to true.To start, let's define a workflow top-level retries definition: "name": "DoNotRetryStrategy", "maxAttempts": 1 - name: DoNotRetryStrategy maxAttempts: 1 Our retry definitions can be referenced by state actions. For example: "nonRetryableErrors": ["SomeErrorOne", "SomeErrorTwo"] "nonRetryableErrors": ["SomeErrorTwo", "SomeErrorThree"] "functionRef": "MyFourthFunction", "retryRef": "DoNotRetryStrategy" - functionRef: MyFourthFunction retryRef: DoNotRetryStrategy In our example the first action named MyFirstFunction is going to be retried according to the FirstRetryStrategyretry policyfor all errors except SomeErrorOne and SomeErrorTwo. The seconds action named MySecondFunction is going to be retried according to the SecondRetryStrategyretry policyfor all errors except SomeErrorTwo and SomeErrorThree. The third action named MyThirdFunction is going to retried according to the default runtime retry policy.It will be retried for all errors both known (checked) as well as unknown (unckecked). The fourth action named MyFourthFunction is going to be retried according to the DoNotRetryStrategyretry policy which has the maxAttempts property set to 1, meaning that this action will not be retried. Workflow timeouts define the maximum times for: Workflow execution State execution Action execution Branch execution Event consumption time The specification allows for timeouts to be defined on the top-level workflow definition, as well asin each of the workflow state definitions. Note that the timeout settings defined in states, and state branches overwrite the top-levelworkflow definition for state, action and branch execution. If they are not defined, then the top-leveltimeout settings should take in effect. To give an example, let's say that in our workflow definition we define the timeout for state execution: "id": "testWorkflow", ... "timeouts": { "stateExecTimeout": "PT2S" This top-level workflow timeout setting defines that the maximum execution time of all defined workflow statesis two seconds each. Now let's say that we have worfklow states "A" and "B". State "A" does not define a timeout definition, but state"B" does: "name": "B", "type": "operation", "stateExecTimeout": "PT10S" Since state "A" does not overwrite the top-level stateExecTimeout, its execution timeout should be inherited fromthe top-level timeout definition.On the other hand, state "B" does define it's own stateExecTimeout, in which case it would overwrite the defaultsetting, meaning that it would its execution time has a max limit of ten seconds. Defining timeouts is not mandatory, meaning that if not defined, all the timeout settings should be assumed tobe "unlimited". Note that the defined workflow execution timeout has precedence over all other defined timeouts.Just to give an extreme example, let's say we define the workflow execution timeout to ten seconds,and the state execution timeout to twenty seconds. In this case if the workflow execution timeout is reachedit should follow the rules of workflow execution timeout and end workflow execution, no matter what thestate execution time has been set to. Let's take a look all possible timeout definitions: Workflow timeouts are defined with the top-level timeouts property. It can have two types, string and object.If string type it defines an URI that points to a Json or Yaml file containing the workflow timeout definitions.If object type, it is used to define the timeout definitions in-line and has the following properties: workflowExecTimeout Workflow execution timeout (ISO 8601 duration format) string or object no stateExecTimeout Workflow state execution timeout (ISO 8601 duration format) string no actionExecTimeout Actions execution timeout (ISO 8601 duration format) string no branchExecTimeout Branch execution timeout (ISO 8601 duration format) string no eventTimeout Default timeout for consuming defined events (ISO 8601 duration format) string no The eventTimeout property defines the maximum amount of time to wait to consume defined events. If not specified it should default to"unlimited". The branchExecTimeout property defines the maximum execution time for a single branch. If not specified it should default to"unlimited". The actionExecTimeout property defines the maximum execution time for a single actions definition. If not specified it should default to"unlimited". Note that an action definition can include multiple actions. The stateExecTimeout property defines the maximum execution time for a single workflow state. If not specified it should default to"unlimited". The workflowExecTimeout property defines the workflow execution timeout.It is defined using the ISO 8601 duration format. If not defined, the workflow execution should be given "unlimited"amount of time to complete.workflowExecTimeout can have two possibly types, either string or object.If string type, it defines the maximum workflow execution time.If Object type it has the following format: WORKFLOWEXECTIMEOUT DEFINITION duration Timeout duration (ISO 8601 duration format) string yes interrupt If false, workflow instance is allowed to finish current execution. If true, current workflow execution is stopped immediately. Default is false boolean no runBefore Name of a workflow state to be executed before workflow instance is terminated string no "duration": "PT2M", "runBefore": "createandsendreport" duration: PT2M runBefore: createandsendreport The duration property defines the time duration of the execution timeout. Once a workflow instance is created,and the amount of the defined time is reached, the workflow instance should be terminated. The interrupt property defines if the currently running instance should be allowed to finish its currentexecution flow before it needs to be terminated. If set to true, the current instance execution should stop immediately. The runBefore property defines a name of a workflow state to be executed before workflow instance is terminated.States referenced by runBefore (as well as any other states that they transition to) must obey following rules: They should not have any incoming transitions (should not be part of the main workflow control-flow logic) They cannot be states marked for compensation (have their usedForCompensation property set to true) If it is a single state, it must define an end definition, if it transitions to other states,at last one must define it. They can transition only to states are also not part of the main control flow logic (and are not markedfor compensation). Runtime implementations should raise compile time / parsing exceptions if any of the rules mentioned above arenot obeyed in the workflow definition. All workflow states except Sleep and Inject States can define the timeouts property and can define different timeoutsettings depending on their state type.Please reference each workflow state definitions for more information on whichtimeout settings are available for each state type. Workflow states timeouts cannot define the workflowExecTimeout property. Workflow states can set their stateExecTimeout property inside the timeouts definition.The value of this property is a time duration (ISO 8601 duration format).It must be a duration that's greater than zero and defines the total state execution timeout.When this timeout is reached, state executionshould be stopped and can be handled as a timeout error in the states onErrors definition. Parallel states can define the branchExecTimeout property. If defined on the statelevel, it applies to each branch of the Parallel state. Note that each parallel state branchcan overwrite this setting to define its own branch execution timeout.If a branch does not define this timeout property, it should be inherited from it's state definition branch timeout setting.If its state does not define it either, it should be inherited from the top-level workflow branch timeout settings. The Event state timeouts property can be used tospecify state specific timeout settings. For event state it can contain the eventTimeout propertywhich is defined using the ISO 8601 data and time format.You can specify for example "PT15M" to represent 15 minutes or "P2DT3H4M" to represent 2 days, 3 hours and 4 minutes.eventTimeout values should always be represented as durations and not as specific time intervals. The eventTimeout property needs to be described in detail for Event states as it depends on whether or not the Event state is a workflow starting state or not. If the Event state is a workflow starting state, incoming events may trigger workflow instances. In this case,if the exclusive property is set to true, the eventTimeout property should be ignored. If the exclusive property is set to false, in this case, the defined eventTimeout represents the timebetween arrival of specified events. To give an example, consider the following: "name": "ExampleEventState", "type": "event", "exclusive": false, "timeouts": { "eventTimeout": "PT2M" "onEvents": [ "eventRefs": [ "ExampleEvent1", "ExampleEvent2" ... ] "end": { "terminate": true The first eventTimeout would start once any of the referenced events are consumed. If the second event does not occur withinthe defined eventTimeout, no workflow instance should be created. If the event state is not a workflow starting state, the eventTimeout property is relative to the time when thestate becomes active. If the defined event conditions (regardless of the value of the exclusive property)are not satisfied within the defined timeout period, the event state should transition to the next state or end the workflowinstance in case it is an end state without performing any actions. Compensation deals with undoing or reversing the work of one or more states which havealready successfully completed. For example, let's say that we have charged a customer $100 for an itempurchase. In the case customer laster on decides to cancel this purchase we need to undo it. One way ofdoing that is to credit the customer $100. It's important to understand that compensation with workflows is not the same as for example rolling backa transaction (a strict undo). Compensating a workflow state which has successfully completedmight involve multiple logical steps and thus is part of the overall business logic that must bedefined within the workflow itself. To explain this let's use our previous example and say that when ourcustomer made the item purchase, our workflow has sent her/him a confirmation email. In the case, tocompensate this purchase, we cannot just "undo" the confirmation email sent. Instead, we want tosend a second email to the customer which includes purchase cancellation information. Compensation in Serverless Workflow must be explicitly defined by the workflow control flow logic.It cannot be dynamically triggered by initial workflow data, event payloads, results of service invocations, orerrors. Each workflow state can define how it should be compensated via its compensatedBy property.This property references another workflow state (by its unique name) which is responsible for the actual compensation. States referenced by compensatedBy (as well as any other states that they transition to) must obey following rules: They cannot be an event state They cannot define an end definition. If they do, it should be ignored They must define the usedForCompensation property and set it to true They can transition only to states which also have their usedForCompensation property set to true They cannot themselves set their compensatedBy property to any state (compensation is not recursive) Let's take a look at an example workflow state which defines its compensatedBy property, and the compensationstate it references: "states": [ "name": "NewItemPurchase", "type": "event", "onEvents": [ "eventRefs": [ "NewPurchase" ], "actions": [ "refName": "DebitCustomerFunction", "customerid": "${ .purchase.customerid }", "amount": "${ .purchase.amount }" "refName": "SendPurchaseConfirmationEmailFunction", "customerid": "${ .purchase.customerid }" ] ], "compensatedBy": "CancelPurchase", "transition": "SomeNextWorkflowState" "name": "CancelPurchase", "type": "operation", "usedForCompensation": true, "actions": [ "refName": "CreditCustomerFunction", "customerid": "${ .purchase.customerid }", "amount": "${ .purchase.amount }" "refName": "SendPurchaseCancellationEmailFunction", "customerid": "${ .purchase.customerid }" - name: NewItemPurchase type: event onEvents: - eventRefs: - NewPurchase actions: - functionRef: refName: DebitCustomerFunction arguments: customerid: "${ .purchase.customerid }" amount: "${ .purchase.amount }" refName: SendPurchaseConfirmationEmailFunction compensatedBy: CancelPurchase transition: SomeNextWorkflowState - name: CancelPurchase type: operation usedForCompensation: true refName: CreditCustomerFunction customerid: "${ .purchase.customerid }" amount: "${ .purchase.amount }" refName: SendPurchaseCancellationEmailFunction In this example our "NewItemPurchase" event state waits for a "NewPurchase" event and thendebits the customer and sends them a purchase confirmation email. It defines that it's compensated by the"CancelPurchase" operation state which performs two actions, namely credits back thepurchase amount to customer and sends them a purchase cancellation email. As previously mentioned, compensation must be explicitly triggered by the workflows control-flow logic.This can be done via transition and end definitions. Let's take a look at each: Compensation triggered on transition: "transition": { "compensate": true, "nextState": "NextWorkflowState" transition: compensate: true nextState: NextWorkflowState Transitions can trigger compensations by specifying the compensate property and setting it to true.This means that before the transition is executed (workflow continues its execution to the "NextWorkflowState" in this example),workflow compensation must be performed. Compensation triggered by end definition: "end": { "compensate": true End definitions can trigger compensations by specifying the compensate property and setting it to true.This means that before workflow finishes its execution workflow compensation must be performed. Note thatin case when the end definition has its produceEvents property set, compensation must be performed beforeproducing the specified events and ending workflow execution.In the case the end definition has a continueAs property defined, compensation must be performed beforeworkflow execution continues as a new workflow invocation.In the case where the end definition has both produceEvents, and continueAs compensation is performed first,then the event should be produced, and then the workflow should continue its execution as a new workflow invocation. Now that we have seen how to define and trigger compensation, we need to go into details on how compensation should be executed.Compensation is performed on all already successfully completed states (that define compensatedBy) in reverse order.Compensation is always done in sequential order, and should not be executed in parallel. Let's take a look at the following workflow image: In this example lets say our workflow execution is at the "End" state which defines the compensate property to trueas shown in the previous section. States with a red border, namely "A", "B", "D" and "E" are states which have so farbeen executed successfully. State "C" has not been executed during workflow execution in our example. When workflow execution encounters our "End" state, compensation has to be performed. This is done in reverse order: State "E" is not compensated as it does not define a compensatedBy state State "D" is compensated by executing compensation "D1" State "B" is compensated by executing "B1" and then "B1-2" State C is not compensated as it was never active during workflow execution State A is not comped as it does not define a compensatedBy state So if we look just at the workflow execution flow, the same workflow could be seen as: In our example, when compensation triggers,the current workflow data is passed as input to the "D1" state, the first compensation state for our example.The states data output is then passed as states data input to "B1", and so on. In some cases when compensation is triggered, some states such as Parallel and ForEachstates can still be "active", meaning they still might have some async executions that are being performed. If compensation needs to performed on such still active states, the state execution must be first cancelled.After it is cancelled, compensation should be performed. States that are marked as usedForCompensation can define error handling via theironErrors property just like any other workflow states. In case of unrecoverable errors during their execution(errors not explicitly handled),workflow execution should be stopped, which is the same behavior as when not using compensation as well. In some cases our workflows are deployed and executed on runtimes and/or cloud platforms that expose someexecution limitations such as finite execution duration, finite number of workflow transitions, etc.Some runtimes, especially when dealing with stateful workflow orchestrations have a finite limit ofexecution history log sizes, meaning that once a long-running workflow reaches these limits workflow executions islikely to be forced to stop before reaching its completion. This can result in unexpected issues, especially withmission-critical workflows. For those cases, the Serverless Workflow DSL provides a way to explicitly define stopping the current workflowinstance execution, and starting a new one (for the same workflow id or a different one).This can be done via the end definitions continueAs property. The end definitions continueAs can be either of type string or object.If string type, it contains the unique workflow id of the workflow that the execution should continue as, for example: { "continueAs": "myworkflowid" Defining this should stop the current workflow execution, and continue execution as a new workflow instance of theworkflow which defines the workflow id of "myworkflowid". The state data where this is define shouldbecome the workflow data input of the workflow that is continuing the current workflow execution. Note that any defined produceEvents and compensate definitions should be honored before continueAs is applied. If object type, the continueAs property has the following properties: workflowId Unique id of the workflow to continue execution as. string yes version Version of the workflow to continue execution as. string no data If string type, a workflow expression which selects parts of the states data output to become the workflow data input of continued execution. If object type, a custom object to become the workflow data input of the continued execution. string or object no workflowExecTimeout Workflow execution timeout to be used by the workflow continuing execution. Overwrites any specific settings set by that workflow. string or object no Continuing execution with continueAs can also be used inside sub-workflow executions, which brings its next use case. Workflows can invoke sub-workflows during their execution. In Serverless Workflow DSL, sub-workflows are invokedsimilarly to other function types via the SubFlowRef Definitionin workflow states Action definitions. Just like "parent" workflows, sub-workflow can also be long-running, and can run into the same type of runtime/serverless platformlimitations as previously discussed. As such they can also use continueAs to stop their current execution and continue it asa new one of the same or different workflow id. Note that when a sub-workflow is invoked it can produce a result that is then merged into the parent workflow state data.This may bring up a question as to what happens when a sub-workflow calls continueAs in terms of what is returned asresult to of its invocation by the parent workflow. No matter how many times sub-workflow may use continueAs, to the parent workflow it should be as a single invocation is performed,meaning that the results of the last sub-workflow invocation (triggered by continueAs) should be used as thedata returned by the invocation of the sub-workflow to the parent workflow. In any application, regardless of size or type, one thing is for sure: changes happen.Versioning your workflow definitions is an important task to consider. Versions indicatechanges or updates of your workflow definitions to the associated execution runtimes. There are two places in the workflow definition where versioning can be applied: Top level workflow definition version property. Actions subflowRef version property. The version property must respect the semantic versioning guidelines. Workflow constants are used to define static, and immutable, data which is available to Workflow Expressions. Constants can be defined via the Workflow top-level "constants" property,for example: "constants": { "Translations": { "Dog": { "Serbian": "pas", "Spanish": "perro", "French": "chien" Constants can only be accessed inside Workflow expressions via the $CONST variable.Runtimes must make $CONST available to expressions as a predefined variable. Here is an example of using constants in Workflow expressions: ..., "condition": "${ .applicant | .age >= $CONST.AGE.MIN_ADULT }", "condition": "${ .applicant | .age < $CONST.AGE.MIN_ADULT }", ... Note that constants can also be used in expression functions,for example: "operation": ".applicant | .age >= $CONST.AGE.MIN_ADULT", "operation": ".applicant | .age < $CONST.AGE.MIN_ADULT", Workflow constants values should only contain static data, meaning that their value should notcontain Workflow expressions.Workflow constants data must be immutable.Workflow constants should not have access to Workflow secrets definitions. Secrets allow you access sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, ssh keys, etcinside your Workflow Expressions. You can define the names of secrets via the Workflow top-level "secrets" property,for example: If secrets are defined in a Workflow definition, runtimes must assure to provide their valuesduring Workflow execution. Secrets can be used only in Workflow expressions by referencing them via the $SECRETS variable.Runtimes must make $SECRETS available to expressions as a predefined variable. Here is an example on how to use secrets and pass them as arguments to a function invocation: "secrets": ["AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT", "AZURE_STORAGE_KEY"], "refName": "uploadToAzure", "account": "${ $SECRETS.AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT }", "account-key": "${ $SECRETS.AZURE_STORAGE_KEY }", ... Note that secrets can also be used in expression functions. Secrets are immutable, meaning that workflow expressions are not allowed to change their values. Metadata enables you to enrich the serverless workflow model with information beyond its core definitions.It is intended to be used by clients, such as tools and libraries, as well as users that find this information relevant. Metadata should not affect workflow execution. Implementations may choose to use metadata information or ignore it.Note, however, that using metadata to control workflow execution can lead to vendor-locked implementations that do not comply with the main goals of this specification, which is to be completely vendor-neutral. Metadata includes key/value pairs (string types). Both keys and values are completely arbitrary and non-identifying. Metadata can be added to: Function definitions Event definitions State definitions Switch state data and event conditions. Here is an example of metadata attached to the core workflow definition: "id": "processSalesOrders", "name": "Process Sales Orders", "start": "MyStartingState", "category": "Sales", "giturl": "github.com/myproject", "author": "Author Name", "team": "Team Name", ... Some other examples of information that could be recorded in metadata are: UI tooling information such as sizing or scaling factors. Build, release, or image information such as timestamps, release ids, git branches, PR numbers, etc. Logging, monitoring, analytics, or audit repository information. Labels used for organizing/indexing purposes, such as "release" "stable", "track", "daily", etc. Similar to Constants and Secrets, workflows expressions can have access to the context information of a running instance via the keyword WORKFLOW. Implementations may use this keyword to give access to any relevant information of the running instance within an expression. For example: "functions": [{ "name": "myFunction", "operation": "myopenapi.json#myFunction" }], "states":[ "name":"MyStartingState", "type":"operation", "actions": [{ "functionRef": "myFunction", "args": { "order": "${ .orderId }", "callerId": "${ $WORKFLOW.instanceId }" }] In this use case, a third-party service may require information from the caller for traceability purposes. The specification doesn't define any specific variable within the WORKFLOW bucket, but it's considered a reserved keyword. The workflow extension mechanism allows you to enhance your model definitions with additional information useful forthings like analytics, rate limiting, logging, simulation, debugging, tracing, etc. Model extensions do no influence control flow logic (workflow execution semantics).They enhance it with extra information that can be consumed by runtime systems or tooling andevaluated with the end goal being overall workflow improvements in terms of time, cost, efficiency, etc. Serverless Workflow specification provides extensions which can be found here. You can define extensions in your workflow definition using its top-level extensions property.For more information about this property, see the extensions property in theWorkflow Definition Structure section. Even tho users can define their own extensions, it is encouraged to use the ones provided by the specification.We also encourage users to contribute their extensions to the specification. That way they can be sharedwith the rest of the community. If you have an idea for a new workflow extension, or would like to enhance an existing one,please open an New Extension Request issue in this repository.

They can come from a database, service, file, or be generated in-memory. To add a new dataset in Visual Studio: Right click on the Data Sources folder in Solution Explorer and select Add New Data Source. Choose the data source type (database, service, object, etc). Configure the connection and select the specific database/tables/objects to include. The Dataset Designer allows you to visually shape and configure datasets: Drag tables/objects onto the designer surface to include them. Set primary keys, foreign keys, relations, column data types. Preview and filter the data. Typed Datasets provide a strongly-typed collection of objects to access data: Drag tables onto the Typed Dataset designer. It generates strongly-typed classes to represent each table. You can then program against the strongly-typed dataset. TableAdapters in typed datasets expose methods like Fill, Insert, Update, Delete to manipulate data. You can customize and extend typed datasets, for example: Add custom methods or properties. Add validation logic. Add relations between tables. Generate custom SQL queries. So in summary, Visual Studio provides a graphical way to create datasets from data sources, configure them, and generate strongly-typed code for programming against the data. The Dataset Designer and Typed Dataset features are key tools for this. .md Python .md : import os from pathlib import Path repo_path = Path('/path/to/repo') md_files = [] for root, dirs, files in os.walk(repo_path): for file in files: if file.endswith('.md'): file_path = os.path.join(root, file) md_files.append(file_path) print(f'Found {len(md_files)} .md files') for file in md_files: with open(file, 'r') as f: content = f.read() print(f'Scanned file {file}') : os.walk. md_files .md . .md (, ). . GitHub, GitLab . https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io/container_registry/1746675 Here are the key points about the GitLab container registry link you shared: It is a container registry hosted on GitLab at https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io/container_registry The specific image it links to is graphviz/graphviz:latest This appears to be a Docker image for Graphviz - an open source graph visualization software. The Dockerfile for this image is available in the repository here: https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io/-/blob/master/Dockerfile It builds Graphviz from source code and installs it into a Ubuntu base image. It exposes ports 8080 and 8081 for web visualization of graphs. The image description states it can be used to generate graphs from DOT language scripts. This Docker image allows running Graphviz in a portable containerized environment. It can be pulled with docker pull registry.gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io:latest And run like: docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 registry.gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io:latest So in summary, this GitLab container registry link points to an official Docker image for running the Graphviz graph visualization software. The image is built from source and exposes web ports to view generated graphs. Read 10 files Unfortunately I do not have access to run Docker containers directly. However, based on the GitLab container registry link and Docker run command you provided, here is a summary: The command docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 registry.gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io:latest would run the Graphviz Docker image hosted at the GitLab container registry. Specifically: registry.gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io:latest refers to the Docker image location. -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 maps ports 8080 and 8081 from the container to the host machine. This allows accessing the Graphviz web visualization server on those ports after running the container. The image can be pulled with docker pull registry.gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io:latest Once running, Graphviz can be used to generate graphs by passing DOT language scripts to the web UI or API exposed on ports 8080 and 8081.

First, Iam going to explain what Midjourney is and what it can do. Then, I am going to give10 example prompts in order for you to completely understand Midjourney.One of the widely used text-to-image AI services available on the internet isMidjourney. Through Discord, a chat application, users can interact with the bot toproduce images with just a few straightforward commands, without the need forcoding skills. The results are visually attractive images that are easy to create.You can Interact with the Midjourney Bot on Discord using a {{glossary.Command}}.Commands are used to create images, change default settings, monitor user info,and perform other helpful tasks.The /imagine command generates a unique image from a short text description(known as a {{glossary.Prompt}}).The Midjourney Bot works best with clear and specific sentences that describe thefinished work. It does not work well with conversational style lists of requests. Ratherthan providing specific instructions, such as 'Show me a picture of lots of bloomingCalifornia poppies, make them bright, vibrant orange, and draw them in anillustrated style with colored pencils,' try describing what you want in a morestraightforward manner, such as 'Vibrant orange California poppies illustrated withcolored pencils.Generating an image activates the free Midjourney trial.Trial users can make roughly25 Jobs before needing to subscribe. A Job is any action that uses the MidjourneyBot. Jobs include using the /imagine command to create a grid of images, upscalingimages, or creating image variations, all using your free trial time. Use the /infocommand to check your Fast Time Remaining to see your remaining Trial time.Here are some prompting notes:Prompt LengthPrompts can be very simple. Single words (or even an emoji!) will produce an image.Very short prompts will rely heavily on Midjourneys default style, so a more descriptive prompt is better for a unique look. However, super-long prompts arentalways better. Concentrate on the main concepts you want to create.GrammarThe Midjourney Bot does not understand grammar, sentence structure, or words likehumans. Word choice also matters. More specific synonyms work better in manycircumstances. Instead of big, try gigantic, enormous, or immense. Remove wordswhen possible. Fewer words mean each word has a more powerful influence. Usecommas, brackets, and hyphens to help organize your thoughts, but know theMidjourney Bot will not reliably interpret them. The Midjourney Bot does notconsider capitalization. Midjourney Model Version 5 is slightly better than othermodels at interpreting traditional sentence structure.Focus on What you WantIt is better to describe what you want instead of what you dont want. If you ask for aparty with no cake, your image will probably include a cake. If you want to ensurean object is not in the final image, try advance prompting using the --no parameter.Think About What Details MatterAnything left unsaid may surprise you. Be as specific or vague as you want, butanything you leave out will be randomized. Being vague is a great way to get variety,but you may not get the specific details you want.Try to be clear about any context or details that are important to you. Thinkabout:Subject: person, animal, character, location, object, etc.Medium: photo, painting, illustration, sculpture, doodle, tapestry, etc.Environment: indoors, outdoors, on the moon, in Narnia, underwater, the EmeraldCity, etc.Lighting: soft, ambient, overcast, neon, studio lights, etcColor: vibrant, muted, bright, monochromatic, colorful, black and white, pastel, etc.Mood: Sedate, calm, raucous, energetic, etc.Composition: Portrait, headshot, closeup, birds-eye view, etc.Use Collective NounsPlural words leave a lot to chance. Try specific numbers. "Three cats" is more specificthan "cats." Collective nouns also work, flock of birds instead of "birds. Parameters AvailableAspect Ratios--aspect, or --ar Change the aspect ratio of a generation.Chaos--chaos <number 0100> Change how varied the results will be. Higher valuesproduce more unusual and unexpected generations.No--no Negative prompting, --no plants would try to remove plants from the image.Quality--quality <.25, .5, 1, or 2>, or --q <.25, .5, 1, or 2> How much rendering quality time youwant to spend. The default value is 1. Higher values cost more and lower values costless.Repeat--repeat <140>, or --r <140> Create multiple Jobs from a single prompt. --repeat isuseful for quickly rerunning a job multiple times.Seed--seed <integer between 04294967295> The Midjourney bot uses a seed number tocreate a field of visual noise, like television static, as a starting point to generate theinitial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can bespecified with the --seed or --sameseed parameter. Using the same seed numberand prompt will produce similar ending images.Stop--stop <integer between 10100> Use the --stop parameter to finish a Job part waythrough the process. Stopping a Job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, lessdetailed results.Style--style <4a, 4b, or 4c> Switch between versions of the Midjourney Model Version 4--style <expressive, or cute> Switch between versions of the Niji Model VersionStylize--stylize , or --s parameter influences how strongly Midjourney'sdefault aesthetic style is applied to Jobs. Uplight--uplight Use an alternative "light" upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The resultsare closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image is less detailed andsmoother.Upbeta--upbeta Use an alternative beta upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The resultsare closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image has significantly feweradded details.Midjourney routinely releases new model versions to improve efficiency, coherency,and quality. Different models excel at different types of images.Niji--niji An alternative model focused on anime style images.Test--test Use the Midjourney special test model.Testp--testp Use the Midjourney special photography-focused test model.Version--version <1, 2, 3, 4, or 5> or --v <1, 2, 3, 4, or 5> Use a different version of the Midjourneyalgorithm. The current algorithm (V4) is the default setting.Now that you understand the basics of MidJourney here are some example promptsto further understand how these are typed out:astronaut playing chess against a monkey, 2d flat, simple, vibrant, neon colors, fun,groovy, chess pieces floating, set on the moon, movie poster, epica magical, vibrant, steampunk, Erlenmeyer Flask with a red, boiling substance, sittingon a white table, white background, 4kjapanese lofi style, the streets of neo tokyo, with a porsche 911 in the street, massiveskyscraper in the background, 64 bit style, shadows and lighting, clean, simple,satisfyingDreamy pastel portrait, female model, long wavy hair, soft gaze, flowery headpiece,delicate makeup, ethereal atmosphere, soft focus, medium format film, MamiyaRZ67, Fujifilm Pro 400H, f3.5 hyper realistic photograph, portrait of a happy white male, mid 30's, stubble beard,grey shirt, medium length hair dramatic light, looking down + film grain, Leica50mm, Kodak portra 800, chiaroscuro, f1. 4, golden hour --ar 3:4hyper realistic photograph, portrait of a tattooed south American indigenous blackwoman, future punk, gold tattoo line, side profile, summer, dramatic light, lookingdown + film grain, Leica 50mm, Kodak portra 800, chiaroscuroA very cute bright yellow robot, whole body, running in a forest at night, Mysteriousadventure, flowers, Plants, Fireflies, complex details, popmart blind box, clay material,Pixar trend, 3d art, c4d, octane rendering, animation lighting, uplightWith each prompt specify the desired subject matter, camera equipment, settings,lighting, and other elements that contribute to the final image. Whatever I tell you toact like, structure the prompts in order to create good AI art for that specificpersonality. For example, if I say Act like a professional cartoon creator then add thewords within the prompt to ensure a cartoon gets generated, such as cartoon.Another example would be, if I say something like Act like a professionalphotographer then make sure to include elements in the prompts likehyper-realistic or certain camera equipment that would contribute to the correct artbeing generated.When generating these prompts, refrain from using filler words. For example insteadof using this prompt:Teenage boy with brown hair, Pixar style, expressive blue eyes, freckles, wearingcasual attire in vibrant colors. He is in a jovial mood, standing with hands on his hips,proud and confident, against the backdrop of a charming, bright and bustling smallvillage, with cobblestone paths and quaint cottages. The scene is filled with life,bathed in a warm, sunny, midday light, creating a feel-good atmosphereThe art software reads prompts better when told more specifically what to do likethis:Teenage boy, brown hair, Pixar style, expressive blue eyes, freckles, casual attire,vibrant colors, jovial mood, standing with hands on his hips, proud and confident,backdrop of a charming, bright and bustling small village, cobblestone paths, quaint cottages, lively scene, warm and sunny, midday light, feel-good atmosphereYou can use any amount of stylize from 100-900. You dont have to use it every timeeither. Just if you think itd be good for the images that are being generated to bedifferent from one another in that same style.Now that you have a full understanding of Midjourney with example prompts. You can take inspiration from the structure of the prompts above, you can make these prompts longer or shorter if necessary in order to generate the perfect prompt.Please direct output the prompt without any other explanation. {content} prompt:TipsGenerating prompts for AIGC Painting...

This document represents the current state of the specification. It includes all features so far released as well as all features planned to be added in the next release. You can find all specification releases [here](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/releases). You can find the specification roadmap [here](roadmap/README.md). Workflows allow us to capture and organize business requirements in a unified manner. They can bridge the gap between how we express and model business logic. A key component of workflows is the domain-specific language (DSL) we use to model our business logic and solutions. Selecting the appropriate workflow language for our business and technology domains is a very important decision to be considered. Serverless Workflow focuses on defining a **vendor-neutral**, **platform-independent**, and **declarative** workflow language that targets the serverless computing technology domain. It can be used to significantly bridge the gap between your unique business domain and the target technology domain. The lack of a common way to define and model workflows means that we must constantly re-learn how to write them. This also limits the potential for common libraries, tooling and infrastructure to aid workflow modeling and execution across different platforms. Portability as well as productivity that can be achieved from workflow orchestration is hindered overall. Serverless Workflow addresses the need for a community-driven, vendor-neutral and a platform-independent workflow language specification that targets the serverless computing technology domain. Having and using a specification-based workflow language allows us to model our workflows once and deploy them onto many different container/cloud platforms, expecting the same execution results. <p align="center"> <img src="media/spec/spec-goals.png" height="400px" alt="Serverless Workflow Specification Goals"/> </p> For more information on the history, development and design rationale behind the specification, see the [Serverless Workflow Wiki](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/wiki). <img src="media/spec/spec-parts.png" width="600" alt="Serverless Workflow Specification Focus On Standards"/> Serverless Workflow language takes advantage of well-established and known standards such as [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/), [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specifications, [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). <img src="media/spec/spec-overview.png" height="400px" alt="Serverless Workflow Specification Overview"/> * Definitions of the workflow language. This is defined via the [Workflow JSON Schema](schema/workflow.json). You can use both [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) and [YAML](https://yaml.org/) formats to model your workflows. * Software Development Kits (SDKs) for [Go](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-go), [Java](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-java), [.NET](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-net), [Typescript](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-typescript) and [Python](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-python), and we plan to add them for more languages in the future. * Set of [Workflow Extensions](extensions/README.md) which allow users to define additional, non-execution-related workflow information. This information can be used to improve workflow performance. Some example workflow extensions include Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), Rate Limiting, Simulation, Tracing, etc. * Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) to be used as a specification conformance tool for runtime implementations. A workflow definition is a JSON or YAML file that conforms to the Serverless Workflow specification DSL. It consists of the core [Workflow Definition Structure](#Workflow-Definition-Structure) and the [Workflow Model](#Workflow-Model) It defines a blueprint used by runtimes for its execution. A business solution can be composed of any number of related workflow definitions. Their relationships are explicitly modeled with the Serverless Workflow language (for example by using [SubFlowRef Definition](#SubFlowRef-Definition) in actions). A workflow instance represents a single workflow execution corresponding to the instructions provided by a workflow definition. A workflow instance can be short or long-running. A single workflow instance should be isolated, meaning it should not share state and data with other workflow instances. Workflow instances should be able to communicate with each other via events. Depending on their workflow definition, workflow instances can be short-lived or can execute for days, weeks, or years. Each workflow instances should have its unique identifier, which should remain unchanged throughout its execution. Workflow instances can be started providing some data input. This is described in detail in the [workflow data input](#Workflow-Data-Input) section. Workflow instances can also wait for examples to start their execution, which is the case where a workflow definition contains a [EventState](#Event-State) starting workflow state. The workflow definition also explicitly defines when a workflow instance should be completed. By default, instances should be completed once there are no active workflow paths (all active paths reach a state containing the default [end definition](#End-Definition)), or if the defined [`workflowExecTimeout`](#Workflow-Timeouts) time is reached. Other ways, such as using the `terminate` property of the [end definition](#End-Definition) to terminate instance execution, or defining an [`workflowExecTimeout`](#Workflow-Timeouts) property are also possible. For long-running workflow-executions, you can utilize the `keepActive` workflow property which provides more control as to when exactly to terminate workflow execution. In cases where a workflow execution should be continued as a new one, the DSL also provides the `continueAs` property which is described in detail in the [Continuing a new Execution](#Continuing-as-a-new-Execution) section. * [Function definitions](#Function-Definition) - Reusable functions that can declare services that need to be invoked, or expressions to be evaluated. * [Event definitions](#Event-Definition) - Reusable declarations of events that need to be `consumed` to start or continue workflow instances, trigger function/service execution, or be `produced` during workflow execution. * [Retry definitions](#Retry-Definition) - Reusable retry definitions. Can specify retry strategies for service invocations during workflow execution. * [Timeout definitions](#Workflow-Timeouts) - Reusable timeout definitions. Can specify default workflow execution timeout, as well as workflow state, action, and branch execution timeouts. * [Errors definition](#Defining-Errors) - Reusable error definitions. Provide domain-specific error definitions which can be referenced in workflow states error handling. * [State definitions](#Workflow-States) - Definition of states, the building blocks of workflow `control flow logic`. States can reference the reusable function, event and retry definitions. Serverless Workflow data is represented in [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) format. Data flow and execution logic go hand in hand, meaning as workflow execution follows the workflow definition logic, so does the workflow data: <img src="media/spec/workflowdataflow.png" height="400" alt="Serverless Workflow Data Flow"/> The initial [Workflow data input](#Workflow-data-input) is passed to the workflow starting state as its data input. When a state finishes its execution, [its data output is passed as data input to the next state](#Information-passing-Between-States) that should be executed. When workflow execution ends, the last executed workflow state's data output becomes the final [Workflow data output](#Workflow-data-output). States can filter their data inputs and outputs using [State Data filters](#State-data-filters). States can also consume events as well as invoke services. These event payloads and service invocation results can be filtered using [Event data filters](#Event-data-filters) and [Action data filters](#Action-data-filters). Data filters use [workflow expressions](#Workflow-Expressions) for selecting and manipulating state data input and output, action inputs and results, and event payloads. Multiple filters can be combined to gain high level of control of your workflow state data. You can find an example of that in [this](#Using-multiple-data-filters) section. Data from consumed events,and action execution results are added/merged to state data. Reference the [data merging section](#Data-Merging) to learn about the merging rules that should be applied. The initial data input into a workflow instance. Must be a valid [JSON object](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-4). If no input is provided, the default data input should be an empty JSON object: ```json <img src="media/spec/workflowdatainput.png" height="350px" alt="Workflow data input"/> States in a workflow can receive data (data input) and produce a data result (data output). The state's data input is typically the previous state's data output. When a state completes its execution, its data output is passed to the state's data input it transitions to. There are two rules to consider here: - If the state is the workflow starting state, its data input is the [workflow data input](#Workflow-data-input). - When workflow execution ends, the data output of the last executed state becomes the [workflow data output](#Workflow-data-output). <img src="media/spec/basic-state-data-passing.png" height="350px" alt="Basic state data passing"/> Each workflow execution should produce a data output. The workflow data output is the data output of the last executed workflow state. | Parameter | Description | Type | Required | | input | Workflow expression to filter the states data input | string | no | | output | Workflow expression that filters the states data output | string | no | <details><summary><strong>Click to view example definition</strong></summary> <p> <table> <tr> <th>JSON</th> <th>YAML</th> </tr> <td valign="top"> </td> ```yaml </table> </details> The state data filters `input` property expression is applied when the workflow transitions to the current state and receives its data input. It can be used to select only data that is needed and disregard what is not needed. If `input` is not defined or does not select any parts of the state's data input, its data input is not filtered. The state data filter `output` property expression is applied right before the state transitions to the next state defined. It filters the state's data output to be passed as data input to the transitioning state. If the current state is the workflow end state, the filtered state's data output becomes the workflow data output. If `output` is not defined or does not select any parts of the state's data output, its data output is not filtered. Results of the `input` expression should become the state data input. Results of the `output` expression should become the state data output. For more information on this you can reference the [data merging](#Data-Merging) section. For the first example, our state only cares about fruits data, and we want to disregard the vegetables. To do this we can define a state filter: <img src="media/spec/state-data-filter-example1.png" height="400px" alt="State Data Filter Example"/> For our second example, let's say that we are interested in the only vegetable "veggie-like". Here we have two ways of filtering our data, depending on if actions within our state need access to all vegetables, or only the ones that are "veggie-like". The states data input filter selects all the vegetables from the main data input. Once all actions have performed, before the state transition or workflow execution completion (if this is an end state), the "output" of the state filter selects only the vegetables which are "veggie like". <img src="media/spec/state-data-filter-example2.png" height="400px" alt="State Data Filter Example"/> | fromStateData | Workflow expression that filters state data that can be used by the action | string | no | | useResults | If set to `false`, action data results are not added/merged to state data. In this case 'results' and 'toStateData' should be ignored. Default is `true`. | boolean | no | | results | Workflow expression that filters the actions data results | string | no | | toStateData | Workflow expression that selects a state data element to which the action results should be added/merged into. If not specified denotes the top-level state data element | string | no | Action data filters can be used inside [Action definitions.](#Action-Definition) Each action can define this filter which can: * Filter the state data to select only the data that can be used within function definition arguments using its `fromStateData` property. * Filter the action results to select only the result data that should be added/merged back into the state data using its `results` property. * Select the part of state data which the action data results should be added/merged to using the `toStateData` property. To give an example, let's say we have an action which returns a list of breads and pasta types. For our workflow, we are only interested into breads and not the pasta. The `results` will filter the action results, which would then be: In this case, our `results` select the first bread and the second element of the pasta array. The `toStateData` expression then selects the `itemsToBuyAtStore` array of the state data to add/merge these results into. With this, after our action executes the state data would be: In the case action results should not be added/merged to state data, we can set the `useResults` property to `false`. In this case, the `results` and `toStateData` properties should be ignored, and nothing is added/merged to state data. If `useResults` is not specified (or it's value set to `true`), action results, if available, should be added/merged to state data. | useData | If set to `false`, event payload is not added/merged to state data. In this case 'data' and 'toStateData' should be ignored. Default is `true`. | boolean | no | | data | Workflow expression that filters the event data (payload) | string | no | Event data filters can be used to filter consumed event payloads. They can be used to: * Filter the event payload to select only the data that should be added/merged into the state data using its `data` property. * Select the part of state data into which the event payload should be added/merged into Allows event data to be filtered and added to or merged with the state data. All events have to be in the CloudEvents format and event data filters can filter both context attributes and the event payload (data) using the `data` property. <img src="media/spec/event-data-filter-example1.png" height="400px" alt="Event Data Filter Example"/> Note that the data input to the Event data filters depends on the `dataOnly` property of the associated [Event definition](#Event-Definition). If this property is not defined (has default value of `true`), Event data filter expressions are evaluated against the event payload (the CloudEvents `data` attribute only). If it is set to `false`, the expressions should be evaluated against the entire CloudEvent (including its context attributes). In the case event data/payload should not be added/merged to state data, we can set the `useData` property to `false`. In this case, the `data` and `toStateData` properties should be ignored, and nothing is added/merged to state data. If `useData` is not specified (or it's value set to `true`), event payload, if available, should be added/merged to state data. As [Event states](#Event-State) can take advantage of all defined data filters. In the example below, we define a workflow with a single event state and show how data filters can be combined. "spanish": "Adios", Here is a sample diagram showing our workflow, each numbered step on this diagram shows a certain defined point during workflow execution at which data filters are invoked and correspond to the numbered items below. <img src="media/spec/using-multiple-filters-example.png" height="400px" alt="Using Multple Filters Example"/> **(1) Workflow execution starts**: Workflow data is passed to our "WaitForCustomerToArrive" event state as data input. Workflow executes its starting state, namely the "WaitForCustomerToArrive" event state. The event state **stateDataFilter** is invoked to filter its data input. The filters "input" expression is evaluated and selects only the "greetings" data. The rest of the state data input should be disregarded. "spanish": "Adios", **(2) CloudEvent of type "customer-arrival-type" is consumed**: Once the event is consumed, the "eventDataFilter" is triggered. Its "data" expression selects the "customer" object from the events data. The "toStateData" expression says that we should add/merge this selected event data to the state data in its "customerInfo" property. If this property exists it should be merged, if it does not exist, one should be created. "spanish": "Adios", **(3) Event state performs its actions**: Before the first action is executed, its actionDataFilter is invoked. Its "fromStateData" expression filters the current state data to select from its data that should be available to action arguments. In this example it selects the "hello" and "customerInfo" properties from the current state data. At this point the action is executed. We assume that for this example "greetingFunction" returns: The action filters "toStateData" expression then defines that we want to add/merge this action result to state data under the "finalCustomerGreeting" element. **(4) Event State Completes Execution**: When our event state finishes its execution, the states "stateDataFilter" "output" filter expression is executed to filter the state data to create the final state data output. Because our event state is also an end state, its data output becomes the final [workflow data output](#Workflow-data-output). Namely: Consumed event data (payload) and action execution results should be merged into the state data. Event and action data filters can be used to give more details about this operation. By default, with no data filters specified, when an event is consumed, its entire data section (payload) should be merged to the state data. Merging should be applied to the entire state data JSON element. In case of event and action filters, their "toStateData" property can be defined to select a specific element of the state data with which merging should be done against. If this element does not exist, a new one should be created first. When merging, the state data element and the data (payload)/action result should have the same type, meaning that you should not merge arrays with objects or objects with arrays etc. When merging elements of type object should be done by inserting all the key-value pairs from both objects into a single combined object. If both objects contain a value for the same key, the object of the event data/action results should "win". To give an example, let's say we have the following state data: Merging array types should be done by concatenating them into a larger array including unique elements of both arrays. To give an example, merging: Merging number types should be done by overwriting the data from events data/action results into the merging element of the state data. For example merging action results: Workflow [functions](#Function-Definition) are reusable definitions for service invocations and/or expression evaluation. They can be referenced by their domain-specific names inside workflow [states](#Workflow-States). * [Using functions for RESTful service invocations](#Using-Functions-for-RESTful-Service-Invocations) * [Using Functions for Async API Service Invocations](#Using-Functions-for-Async-API-Service-Invocations) * [Using functions for gRPC service invocation](#Using-Functions-For-RPC-Service-Invocations) * [Using functions for GraphQL service invocation](#Using-Functions-For-GraphQL-Service-Invocations) * [Using Functions for OData Service Invocations](#Using-Functions-for-OData-Service-Invocations) * [Using functions for expression evaluations](#Using-Functions-For-Expression-Evaluation) * [Defining custom function types](#defining-custom-function-types) We can define if functions are invoked sync or async. Reference the [functionRef](#FunctionRef-Definition) to learn more on how to do this. [Functions](#Function-Definition) can be used to describe services and their operations that need to be invoked during workflow execution. They can be referenced by states [action definitions](#Action-Definition) to clearly define when the service operations should be invoked during workflow execution, as well as the data parameters passed to them if needed. Note that with Serverless Workflow, we can also define invocation of services which are triggered via an event. To learn more about that, please reference the [event definitions](#Event-Definition) section, as well as the [actions definitions](#Action-Definition) [eventRef](#EventRef-Definition) property. Because of an overall lack of a common way to describe different services and their operations, many workflow languages typically chose to define custom function definitions. This approach, however, often runs into issues such as lack of portability, limited capabilities, as well as forcing non-workflow-specific information, such as service authentication, to be added inside the workflow language. To avoid these issues, the Serverless Workflow specification mandates that details about RESTful services and their operations be described using the [OpenAPI Specification](https://www.openapis.org/). OpenAPI is a language-agnostic standard that describes discovery of RESTful services. This allows Serverless Workflow language to describe RESTful services in a portable way, as well as workflow runtimes to utilize OpenAPI tooling and APIs to invoke service operations. It can, as previously mentioned be referenced during workflow execution when the invocation of this service is desired. For example: Note that the referenced function definition type in this case must be `rest` (default type). For more information about functions, reference the [Functions definitions](#Function-Definition) section. [Functions](#Function-Definition) can be used to invoke PUBLISH and SUBSCRIBE operations on a message broker documented by the [Async API Specification](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/v2.1.0). [Async API operations](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/v2.1.0#operationObject) are bound to a [channel](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/v2.1.0#definitionsChannel) which describes the technology, security mechanisms, input and validation to be used for their execution. Let's take a look at a hypothetical Async API document (assumed its stored locally with the file name `streetlightsapi.yaml`) and define a single publish operation: To define a workflow action invocation, we can then use the following workflow [Function Definition](#Function-Definition) and set the `operation` to `onLightMeasured`: Note that the [Function Definition](#Function-Definition)'s `operation` property must have the following format: ```text Also note that the referenced function definition type in this case must have the value `asyncapi`. Our defined function definition can then we referenced in a workflow [action](#Action-Definition), for example: Similar to defining invocations of operations on RESTful services, you can also use the workflow [functions definitions](#Function-Definition) that follow the remote procedure call (RPC) protocol. For RPC invocations, the Serverless Workflow specification mandates that they are described using [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), a widely used RPC system. gRPC uses [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) to define messages, services, and the methods on those services that can be invoked. Let's look at an example of invoking a service method using RPC. For this example let's say we have the following gRPC protocol buffer definition in a myuserservice.proto file: Note that the `operation` property has the following format: Note that the referenced function definition type in this case must be `rpc`. We'll use the following [GraphQL schema definition](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/) to show how that would work with both a query and a mutation: ```graphql In our workflow definition, we can then use a function definition for the `pet` query field as such: Note that the `operation` property has the following format for the `graphql` type: In order to invoke this query, we would use the following `functionRef` parameters: With the parameters for the `functionRef`: Note you can include [expressions](#Workflow-Expressions) in both `arguments` and `selectionSet`: Similar to defining invocations of operations on GraphQL services, you can also use workflow [Functions Definitions](#Function-Definition) to execute complex queries on an [OData](https://www.odata.org/documentation/) service. We start off by creating a workflow [Functions Definitions](#Function-Definition). For example: Note that the `operation` property must follow the following format: In order to invoke the defined [OData](https://www.odata.org/documentation/) function, simply reference it in a workflow [Action Definition](#Action-Definition) and set its function arguments. For example: In order to ensure compatibility of OData support across runtimes, the`arguments` property of an [OData](https://www.odata.org/documentation/) function reference should follow the Serverless Workflow [OData Json schema](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/tree/main/schema/odata.json) In addition to defining RESTful, AsyncAPI, RPC, GraphQL and OData services and their operations, workflow [functions definitions](#Function-Definition) can also be used to define expressions that should be evaluated during workflow execution. Defining expressions as part of function definitions has the benefit of being able to reference them by their logical name through workflow states where expression evaluation is required. Expression functions must declare their `type` parameter to be `expression`. Here we define two reusable expression functions. Expressions in Serverless Workflow can be evaluated against the workflow, or workflow state data. Note that different data filters play a big role as to which parts of the workflow data are being evaluated by the expressions. Reference the [State Data Filters](#State-data-filters) section for more information on this. Our expression functions can also be referenced and executed as part of state [action](#Action-Definition) execution. Let's say we have the following workflow definition: The starting [inject state](#Inject-State) "Initialize Count" injects the count element into our state data, which then becomes the state data input of our "Increment Count" [operation state](#Operation-State). This state defines an invocation of the "Increment Count Function" expression function defined in our workflow definition. This triggers the evaluation of the defined expression. The input of this expression is by default the current state data. Just like with "rest", and "rpc" type functions, expression functions also produce a result. In this case the result of the expression is just the number 1. The actions filter then assigns this result to the state data element "count" and the state data becomes: ``` json Note that the used function definition type in this case must be `expression`. For more information about workflow expressions, reference the [Workflow Expressions](#Workflow-Expressions) section. [Function definitions](#function-definition) `type` property defines a list of function types that are set by the specification. Some runtime implementations might support additional function types that extend the ones defined in the specification. In those cases you can define a custom function type with for example: In this example we define a custom function type that is meant to execute an external [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) script. When a custom function type is specified, the operation property value has a **custom format**, meaning that its format is controlled by the runtime which provides the custom function type. Note that different data filters play a big role as to which parts of the states data are to be used when the expression is evaluated. Reference the [State Data Filtering](#State-data-filters) section for more information about state data filters. By default, all workflow expressions should be defined using the [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) [version 1.6](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases/tag/jq-1.6) syntax. You can find more information on jq in its [manual](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/). Serverless Workflow does not mandate the use of jq and it's possible to use an expression language of your choice with the restriction that a single one must be used for all expressions in a workflow definition. If a different expression language needs to be used, make sure to set the workflow `expressionLang` property to identify it to runtime implementations. Note that using a non-default expression language could lower the portability of your workflow definitions across multiple container/cloud platforms. All workflow expressions in this document, [specification examples](examples/README.md) as well as [comparisons examples](comparisons/README.md) are written using the default jq syntax. Where `expression` can be either an in-line expression, or a reference to a defined [expression function definition](#Using-Functions-For-Expression-Evaluation). To reference a defined [expression function definition](#Using-Functions-For-Expression-Evaluation) the expression must have the following format, for example: Where `fn` is the namespace of the defined expression functions and `myExprName` is the unique expression function name. We will get back to this function definition in just a bit, but now let's take a look at using an inline expression that sets an input parameter inside an action for example: In this case our input parameter `applicantName` would be set to "John Doe". Expressions can also be used to select and manipulate state data, this is in particularly useful for state data filters. [Switch state](#Switch-State) [conditions](#Switch-State-Data-Conditions) require for expressions to be resolved to a boolean value (`true`/`false`). As previously mentioned, expressions are evaluated against certain subsets of data. For example the `parameters` param of the [functionRef definition](#FunctionRef-Definition) can evaluate expressions only against the data that is available to the [action](#Action-Definition) it belongs to. One thing to note here are the top-level [workflow definition](#Workflow-Definition-Structure) parameters. Expressions defined in them can only be evaluated against the initial [workflow data input](#Workflow-Data-Input). which would set the workflow version to "1.0.0". Note that the workflow "id" property value is not allowed to use an expression. The workflow definition "id" must be a constant value. | --- | --- | --- | --- | | id | Workflow unique identifier | string | yes (if `key` is not defined) | | key | Domain-specific workflow identifier | string | yes (if `id` is not defined) | | name | Workflow name | string | no | | description | Workflow description | string | no | | version | Workflow version.

Following figure describes the main workflow definition blocks. <img src="media/spec/workflowdefinitionblocks.png" height="300px" alt="Serverless Workflow Definitions Blocks"/> The `id` property defines the unique, domain-specific workflow identifier, for example "orders", "payment", etc. The `key` property defines the unique, domain-specific workflow identifier. It can be used when the `id` property is auto-generated by a content-management system for example. In these cases, you can specify the `key` property to be the domain-specific identifier of the workflow definition. The `id` and `key` properties are mutually exclusive, meaning you cannot define both. The `name` property is the workflow logical name. The `description` property can be used to give further information about the workflow. The `version` property can be used to provide a specific workflow version. It must use the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) format. The `annotations` property defines a list of helpful terms describing the workflows intended purpose, subject areas, or other important qualities, for example "machine learning", "monitoring", "networking", etc The `dataInputSchema` and `dataOutputSchema` properties can be used to validate input and output data against a defined JSON Schema. The `dataInputSchema` property validates the [workflow data input](#Workflow-Data-Input). Validation should be performed before any states are executed. In case of a start [Event state](#Event-state) the input schema is ignored, if present. The `failOnValidationErrors` property determines if workflow execution should continue in case of validation errors. The `dataOutputSchema` property validates the [Workflow data output](#workflow-data-output). Validation is performed on the output of the workflow execution. The `failOnValidationErrors` property determines what should be done when the workflow output does not match the provided schema. If `failOnValidationErrors` is true, an error should be thrown. If executed within a subprocess, that error can be be handled by the parent workflow. If `failOnValidationErrors` is false, the error should not be propagated. It is up to the implementor to warn the user about that fact. For example, printing a log. Both properties can be expressed as object or string type. If using object type, their `schema` property might be an URI, which points to the JSON schema used to validate the workflow data input, or it might be the JSON schema object. `failOnValidationErrors` is optional, default value is `true`. If using string type, then the string value is the external schema URI and `failOnValidationErrors` default value of `true` is assumed. The `secrets` property allows you to use sensitive information such as passwords, OAuth tokens, ssh keys, etc. inside your Workflow expressions. It has two possible types, `string` or `array`. If `string` type, it is an URI pointing to a JSON or YAML document which contains an array of names of the secrets, for example: If `array` type, it defines an array (of string types) which contains the names of the secrets, for example: For more information about Workflow secrets, reference the [Workflow Secrets section](#Workflow-Secrets). The `constants` property can be used to define Workflow constants values which are accessible in [Workflow Expressions](#Workflow-Expressions). It has two possible types, `string` or `object`. which contains an object of global definitions, for example: If `object` type, it defines a JSON object which contains the constants definitions, for example: For more information see the [Workflow Constants](#Workflow-Constants) section. The `start` property defines the workflow starting information. For more information see the [start definition](#Start-Definition) section. This property is not required. If not defined, the workflow starting state has to be the very first state defined in the [workflow states array](#Workflow-States). The `specVersion` property is used to set the Serverless Workflow specification release version the workflow markup adheres to. It has to follow the specification release versions (excluding the leading "v"), meaning that for the [release version v0.8](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/releases/tag/v0.8) its value should be set to `"0.8"`. The `expressionLang` property can be used to identify the expression language used for all expressions in the workflow definition. The default value of this property is ["jq"](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/). You should set this property if you chose to define [workflow expressions](#Workflow-Expressions) with an expression language / syntax other than the default. The `timeouts` property is used to define the default workflow timeouts for workflow, state, action, and branch execution. For more information about timeouts and its use cases see the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section. The `error` property is used to define checked errors that can be explicitly handled during workflow execution. For more information about workflow error handling see [this section](#Defining-Errors). The `auth` property can be either an inline [auth](#Auth-Definition) definition array, or a URI reference to a resource containing an array of [auth](#Auth-Definition) definitions. If defined in a separate resource file (Json or Yaml), `auth` definitions can be re-used by multiple workflow definitions. Auth definitions can be used to define authentication that should be used to access the resource defined in the `operation` property of the [function](#Function-Definition) definitions. If we have the following function definition: The `authRef` property is used to reference an authentication definition in the `auth` property and should be applied when invoking the `helloWorld` function. An [AuthRef](#AuthRef-Definition) object can alternatively be used to configure the authentication definition to use when accessing the function's resource and/or when invoking the function. The `functions` property can be either an in-line [function](#Function-Definition) definition array, or an URI reference to a resource containing an array of [functions](#Function-Definition) definition. Referenced resource can be used by multiple workflow definitions. 1. Workflow definition: 2. Function definitions resource: Referenced resource must conform to the specifications [Workflow Functions JSON Schema](schema/functions.json). The `events` property can be either an in-line [event](#Event-Definition) definition array, or an [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) reference to a resource containing an array of [event](#Event-Definition) definition. Referenced resource can be used by multiple workflow definitions. 2. Event definitions resource: Referenced resource must conform to the specifications [Workflow Events JSON Schema](schema/events.json). The `retries` property can be either an in-line [retry](#Retry-Definition) definition array, or an URI reference to a resource containing an array of [retry](#Retry-Definition) definition. Referenced resource can be used by multiple workflow definitions. For more information about using and referencing retry definitions see the [Workflow Error Handling](#Workflow-Error-Handling) section. The `keepActive` property allows you to change the default behavior of workflow instances. By default, as described in the [Core Concepts](#Core-Concepts) section, a workflow instance is terminated once there are no more active execution paths, one of its active paths ends in a "terminate" [end definition](#End-Definition), or when its [`workflowExecTimeout`](#Workflow-Timeouts) time is reached. Setting the `keepActive` property to `true` allows you to change this default behavior in that a workflow instance created from this workflow definition can only be terminated if one of its active paths ends in a "terminate" [end definition](#End-Definition), or when This allows you to explicitly model workflows where an instance should be kept alive, to collect (event) data for example. You can reference the [specification examples](#Examples) to see the `keepActive` property in action. The `extensions` property can be used to define extensions for this workflow definition. You can learn more about workflow extensions in the [Extensions](#extensions) section. Sample `extensions` property definition could look like this for example: Here we define two workflow extensions, namely the [rate limiting](extensions/ratelimiting.md) and [kpi](extensions/kpi.md) extensions for our workflow definition. Workflow states define building blocks of the workflow execution instructions. They define the control flow logic instructions on what the workflow is supposed to do. Serverless Workflow defines the following Workflow States: | Name | Description | Consumes events? | Produces events? | Executes actions? | Handles errors/retries? | Allows parallel execution? | Makes data-based transitions? | Can be workflow start state? | Can be workflow end state? | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **[Event](#Event-State)** | Define events that trigger action execution | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | no | yes | yes | | **[Operation](#Operation-State)** | Execute one or more actions | no | yes | yes | yes | yes | no | yes | yes | | **[Switch](#Switch-State)** | Define data-based or event-based workflow transitions | no | yes | no | yes | no | yes | yes | no | | **[Sleep](#Sleep-State)** | Sleep workflow execution for a specific time duration | no | yes | no | yes | no | no | yes | yes | | **[Parallel](#Parallel-State)** | Causes parallel execution of branches (set of states) | no | yes | no | yes | yes | no | yes | yes | | **[Inject](#Inject-State)** | Inject static data into state data | no | yes | no | yes | no | no | yes | yes | | **[ForEach](#ForEach-State)** | Parallel execution of states for each element of a data array | no | yes | no | yes | yes | no | yes | yes | | **[Callback](#Callback-State)** | Manual decision step. Executes a function and waits for callback event that indicates completion of the manual decision | yes | yes | yes | yes | no | no | yes | yes | | name | Unique State name | string | yes | | type | State type | string | yes | | exclusive | If `true`, consuming one of the defined events causes its associated actions to be performed. If `false`, all of the defined events must be consumed in order for actions to be performed. Default is `true` | boolean | no | | [onEvents](#OnEvents-Definition) | Define the events to be consumed and optional actions to be performed | array | yes | | [timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) | State specific timeout settings | object | no | | [stateDataFilter](#State-data-filters) | State data filter definition| object | no | | [transition](#Transitions) | Next transition of the workflow after all the actions have been performed | string or object | yes (if `end` is not defined) | | [onErrors](#Error-Definition) | States error handling definitions | array | no | | [end](#End-Definition) | Is this state an end state | boolean or object | yes (if `transition` is not defined) | | [compensatedBy](#Workflow-Compensation) | Unique name of a workflow state which is responsible for compensation of this state | string | no | | [metadata](#Workflow-Metadata) | Metadata information| object | no | Event states await one or more events and perform actions when they are received. If defined as the workflow starting state, the event state definition controls when the workflow instances should be created. The `exclusive` property determines if the state should wait for any of the defined events in the `onEvents` array, or if all defined events must be present for their associated actions to be performed. Following two figures illustrate the `exclusive` property: <img src="media/spec/event-state-exclusive-true.png" height="300px" alt="Event state with exclusive set to true"/> If the Event state in this case is a workflow starting state, the occurrence of *any* of the defined events would start a new workflow instance. <img src="media/spec/event-state-exclusive-false.png" height="300px" alt="Event state with exclusive set to false"/> If the Event state in this case is a workflow starting state, the occurrence of *all* defined events would start a new workflow instance. In order to consider only events that are related to each other, we need to set the `correlation` property in the workflow [events definitions](#Event-Definition). This allows us to set up event correlation rules against the events extension context attributes. If the Event state is not a workflow starting state, the `timeout` property can be used to define the time duration from the invocation of the event state. If the defined event, or events have not been received during this time, the state should transition to the next state or can end the workflow execution (if it is an end state). The `timeouts` property can be used to define state specific timeout settings. Event states can define the `stateExecTimeout`, `actionExecTimeout`, and `eventTimeout` properties. For more information about Event state specific event timeout settings reference [this section](#Event-Timeout-Definition). For more information about workflow timeouts reference the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section. Note that `transition` and `end` properties are mutually exclusive, meaning that you cannot define both of them at the same time. | actionMode | Should actions be performed sequentially or in parallel. Default is `sequential` | enum | no | | [actions](#Action-Definition) | Actions to be performed | array | yes | | [stateDataFilter](#State-data-filters) | State data filter | object | no | | [onErrors](#Error-Definition) | States error handling and retries definitions | array | no | | [usedForCompensation](#Workflow-Compensation) | If `true`, this state is used to compensate another state. Default is `false` | boolean | no | Operation state defines a set of actions to be performed in sequence or in parallel. Once all actions have been performed, a transition to another state can occur. The `timeouts` property can be used to define state specific timeout settings. Operation states can define the `stateExecTimeout` and `actionExecTimeout` settings. For more information on Workflow timeouts reference the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section. | [dataConditions](#Switch-state-Data-Conditions) | Defined if the Switch state evaluates conditions and transitions based on state data. | array | yes (if `eventConditions` is not defined) | | [eventConditions](#Switch-State-Event-Conditions) | Defined if the Switch state evaluates conditions and transitions based on arrival of events. | array | yes (if `dataConditions` is not defined | | defaultCondition | Default transition of the workflow if there is no matching data conditions or event timeout is reached. Can be a transition or end definition | object | yes | Switch states can be viewed as workflow gateways: they can direct transitions of a workflow based on certain conditions. There are two types of conditions for switch states: * [Data-based conditions](#Switch-State-Data-Conditions) * [Event-based conditions](#Switch-State-Event-Conditions) At times multiple defined conditions can be evaluated to `true` by runtime implementations. Conditions defined first take precedence over conditions defined later. This is backed by the fact that arrays/sequences are ordered in both JSON and YAML. For example, let's say there are two `true` conditions: A and B, defined in that order. Because A was defined first, its transition will be executed, not B's. In case of data-based conditions definition, switch state controls workflow transitions based on the states data. If no defined conditions can be matched, the state transitions is taken based on the `defaultCondition` property. This property can be either a `transition` to another workflow state, or an `end` definition meaning a workflow end. For event-based conditions, a switch state acts as a workflow wait state. It halts workflow execution until one of the referenced events arrive, then making a transition depending on that event definition. If events defined in event-based conditions do not arrive before the states `eventTimeout` property expires, state transitions are based on the defined `defaultCondition` property. The `timeouts` property can be used to define state specific timeout settings. Switch states can define the `stateExecTimeout` setting. If `eventConditions` is defined, the switch state can also define the `eventTimeout` property. For more information on workflow timeouts reference the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section. | duration | Duration (ISO 8601 duration format) to sleep. For example: "PT15M" (sleep 15 minutes), or "P2DT3H4M" (sleep 2 days, 3 hours and 4 minutes) | string | yes | | [transition](#Transitions) | Next transition of the workflow after the sleep | string or object | yes (if `end` is not defined) | Sleep state suspends workflow execution for a given time duration. The delay is defined in its `duration` property using the ISO 8601 duration format. | [branches](#Parallel-State-Branch) | List of branches for this parallel state| array | yes | | completionType | Option types on how to complete branch execution. Default is "allOf" | enum | no | | numCompleted | Used when branchCompletionType is set to `atLeast` to specify the least number of branches that must complete in order for the state to transition/end. | string or number | yes (if `completionType` is `atLeast`) | | [transition](#Transitions) | Next transition of the workflow after all branches have completed execution | string or object | yes (if `end` is not defined) | Parallel state defines a collection of `branches` that are executed in parallel. A parallel state can be seen a state which splits up the current workflow instance execution path into multiple ones, one for each branch. These execution paths are performed in parallel and are joined back into the current execution path depending on the defined `completionType` parameter value. * allOf: All branches must complete execution before the state can transition/end. This is the default value in case this parameter is not defined in the parallel state definition. * atLeast: State can transition/end once at least the specified number of branches have completed execution. In this case you must also specify the `numCompleted` property to define this number. Exceptions may occur during execution of branches of the Parallel state, this is described in detail in [this section](#Parallel-State-Handling-Exceptions). The `timeouts` property can be used to set state specific timeout settings. Parallel states can define the `stateExecTimeout` and `branchExecTimeout` timeout settings. For more information on workflow timeouts reference the [Workflow Timeouts](#Workflow-Timeouts) section. | data | JSON object which can be set as state's data input and can be manipulated via filter | object | yes | | [stateDataFilter](#state-data-filters) | State data filter | object | no | | [transition](#Transitions) | Next transition of the workflow after injection has completed | string or object | yes (if `end` is not defined) | Inject state can be used to inject static data into state data input. Inject state does not perform any actions. It is very useful for debugging, for example, as you can test/simulate workflow execution with pre-set data that would typically be dynamic in nature (e.g., function calls, events). The inject state `data` property allows you to statically define a JSON object which gets added to the states data input. You can use the filter property to control the states data output to the transition state. Here is a typical example of how to use the inject state to add static data into its states data input, which then is passed as data output to the transition state: ```json "name":"SimpleInjectState", "type":"inject", "data": { "person": { "fname": "John", "lname": "Doe", "address": "1234 SomeStreet", "age": 40 "transition": "GreetPersonState" Concepts - elementary units of knowledge in the system Predicates - statements about relations between concepts. Knowledge graph - graph data structure for storing concepts and predicates. vector representation - representation of concepts as vectors in a multidimensional space. Embedding - transformation of objects into vector representation. Transformers - neural network architecture for processing sequences (text). Attention mechanism - selection of currently relevant parts of the context. Logical inference - constructing new statements by applying inference rules. Planning - constructing a sequence of actions to achieve a goal. Analogies - transferring knowledge from one subject area to another by analogy. Skills - fixed work processes for solving certain tasks. MindOS internal format: Uses a graph data structure to represent AI knowledge. The nodes of the graph are concepts and the edges are the connections between them. Concepts are represented as vectors in a multi-dimensional vector space. This allows the semantic proximity of concepts to be measured using cosine distance. Transformer neural networks such as GPT-3 are used for natural language processing. They convert text into a vector representation. For logical inference, rules in the "if-then" format are used. They allow building chains of inferences based on available knowledge. There is an attention mechanism that focuses on currently relevant concepts and ignores others. Mechanisms of memory, planning, reasoning by analogy for solving various tasks are implemented. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt Define the nodes nodes = ['Start', 'GetDest', 'GetDate', 'SearchTrains', 'SelectTrain', 'BookTickets', 'ConfirmOrder', 'SendETicket', 'Finish'] Define the connections edges = [('Start', 'GetDest'), ('GetDest', 'GetDate'), ('GetDate', 'SearchTrains'), ('SearchTrains', 'SelectTrain'), ('SelectTrain', 'BookTickets'), ('BookTickets', 'ConfirmOrder'), ('ConfirmOrder', 'SendETicket'), ('SendETicket', 'Finish')] Create the graph G = nx.DiGraph()G.add_nodes_from(nodes)G.add_edges_from(edges) Visualize the flowchart pos = nx.spring_layout(G)nx.draw_networkx(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_size=1000, node_color='lightblue', font_size=10, font_color='black', edge_color='gray') Save or display the flowchart plt.axis('off')plt.savefig('flowchart.png')plt.show() Read 5 files Here is a code snippet to generate a flowchart from the given nodes and edges: import networkx as nx import matplotlib.pyplot as plt nodes = ['Start', 'GetDest', 'GetDate', 'SearchTrains', 'SelectTrain', 'BookTickets', 'ConfirmOrder', 'SendETicket', 'Finish'] edges = [('Start', 'GetDest'), ('GetDest', 'GetDate'), ('GetDate', 'SearchTrains'), ('SearchTrains', 'SelectTrain'), ('SelectTrain', 'BookTickets'), ('BookTickets', 'ConfirmOrder'), ('ConfirmOrder', 'SendETicket'), ('SendETicket', 'Finish')] G = nx.DiGraph() G.add_nodes_from(nodes) G.add_edges_from(edges) pos = nx.spring_layout(G) nx.draw_networkx(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_size=1000, node_color='lightblue', font_size=10, font_color='black', edge_color='gray') plt.axis('off') plt.savefig('flowchart.png') plt.show() This creates a directed graph from the nodes and edges, generates a spring layout, draws the graph with the specified formatting, and saves/displays the flowchart. /** Copyright (c) 2006-2017, JGraph Ltd Copyright (c) 2006-2017, Gaudenz Alder /(function(){ /* Version */ EditorUi.VERSION = '@DRAWIO-VERSION@'; /** Overrides compact UI setting. */ EditorUi.compactUi = Editor.currentTheme != 'atlas'; /** Overrides default grid color for dark mode */ if (Editor.isDarkMode()) { mxGraphView.prototype.gridColor = mxGraphView.prototype.defaultDarkGridColor; } /** Switch to disable logging for mode and search terms. */ EditorUi.enableLogging = urlParams['stealth'] != '1' && urlParams['lockdown'] != '1' && (/.*.draw.io$/.test(window.location.hostname) || /.*.diagrams.net$/.test(window.location.hostname)) && window.location.hostname != 'support.draw.io'; /** Protocol and hostname to use for embedded files.
