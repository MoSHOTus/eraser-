(Koksal) Evrensel, Pinar & Cingil, Ibrahim & Dogac, Asuman. (1999). A Component-based Workflow System with Dynamic Modifications. 1649. 10.1007/3-540-48521-X_19. . Adapting to changes in its environment dynamically is a very important aspect of workflow systems. In this paper, we propose a component-based workflow system architecture specifically designed for this purpose. To allow for easy modification of workflow instances, an instance is designed as an object that contains all the necessary data and control information as well as its execution history. This feature facilitates to dynamically modify the process definition on instance basis at run time. The system is designed to consist of functional components like, Basic Enactment Service, History Manager, Workflow Monitoring Tool, Dynamic Modification Tool, etc. The clients of the system are coded as network-transportable applets written in Java so that the end user can activate workflow system components by connecting to the Workflow Domain Manager over the Internet. In this paper we also present a workflow process definition language FLOWDL , its graphical representation FLOWGRAPH and a ...
